new Questions Over California Water Project
cri@@ tics and a state law@@ maker say they want more explan@@ ations on who@@ 's paying for a proposed $@@ 16 billion water project back@@ ed by Go@@ v@@ . Jer@@ ry Brow@@ n, after a leading California water district said Brow@@ n@@ 's administration was offering government fun@@ ding to fin@@ ish the planning for the two gi@@ ant water tun@@ n@@ els.
cri@@ tics said the government fun@@ ding described by the Los Angel@@ es@@ -based Met@@ ropol@@ itan Water District on Th@@ urs@@ day could run coun@@ ter to long-@@ standing state ass@@ ur@@ ances that various local water di@@ stric@@ ts, not California it@@ self, would pay for Brow@@ n@@ 's vision of di@@ gging tw@@ in 3@@ 5-@@ mil@@ e-@@ long tun@@ n@@ els to carry water from the S@@ ac@@ r@@ amen@@ to River sou@@ th, mainly for Central and Southern Californi@@ a.
the $@@ 24@@ 8 million in pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary sp@@ ending for the tun@@ n@@ els, which have yet to win regulatory appro@@ val@@ , already is the topic of an on@@ going fed@@ eral aud@@ it.
on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day, state law@@ makers ordered a state au@@ dit of the tun@@ n@@ el@@ s-@@ sp@@ ending as well.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, state spo@@ k@@ es@@ woman N@@ ancy V@@ og@@ el said that despite the account of the Los Angel@@ es@@ -based Met@@ ropol@@ itan Water District, no money from the state@@ 's general fun@@ d would be used fin@@ ishing the current planning phase of the tw@@ in tun@@ n@@ els.
however, op@@ pon@@ ents of the tun@@ n@@ els and a tax@@ pay@@ er group were critical Th@@ urs@@ day, and assem@@ bl@@ y@@ woman S@@ us@@ an E@@ gg@@ man, one of the state law@@ makers behind this week@@ 's au@@ dit order, asked the state Th@@ urs@@ day for cl@@ ari@@ fic@@ ation.
"@@ it's a sh@@ ell g@@ ame@@ ," said David Wol@@ f@@ e, the How@@ ard J@@ ar@@ v@@ is Tax@@ pay@@ ers Associ@@ ation@@ 's legis@@ l@@ ative direc@@ tor.
the tun@@ n@@ els project is endor@@ sed by Brow@@ n and by some poli@@ tically influ@@ ential water di@@ stric@@ ts and water customers in Central and Southern Californi@@ a.
sup@@ por@@ ters say the tun@@ n@@ els would benefit the environment and offer Californi@@ ans a more secure water suppl@@ y.
op@@ pon@@ ents say they fear the state will use the tun@@ n@@ els to di@@ ver@@ t too much water from the S@@ ac@@ r@@ amen@@ to River and San Francisco B@@ ay, harm@@ ing Northern California and further end@@ ang@@ ering native spec@@ ies there.
met@@ ropol@@ itan and other water di@@ stric@@ ts sl@@ ated to get water from the tun@@ n@@ els have yet to comm@@ it to paying for them, out of un@@ certain@@ ty whether the mas@@ sive sp@@ ending would really bring them enough water to make the cost wor@@ th@@ whil@@ e.
the same water di@@ stric@@ ts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary work on the tun@@ n@@ els unless the project first won regulatory appro@@ val@@ .
on Th@@ urs@@ day, a month@@ ly report published by the LA@@ -based water district on the tun@@ n@@ els project said, "the state has indicated that any additional fun@@ ding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or fed@@ eral sourc@@ es."
after all that local water di@@ stric@@ ts had spent on the projec@@ t, including $@@ 63 million from his water district, "This is to be exp@@ ec@@ ted@@ " that the state would use government money to close out plann@@ ing, said Bo@@ b Mu@@ ir@@ , spo@@ k@@ es@@ man for the LA@@ -based water di@@ stric@@ t.
he referred further questions to V@@ og@@ el, the state spo@@ k@@ es@@ wom@@ an.
V@@ og@@ el said the state intended to pul@@ l money to fin@@ ish the tun@@ n@@ els planning from user fees for an exist@@ ing, hal@@ f-@@ centur@@ y-@@ old water net@@ work, the State Water Projec@@ t.
tun@@ nel op@@ pon@@ ents, however, point to a measure state law@@ makers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from sp@@ ending money on the tun@@ n@@ els until the water ag@@ encies that would benefit comm@@ it to paying for them.
"@@ project contrac@@ tors ple@@ dg@@ ed to pay for this project and they@@ 've used financial g@@ im@@ mic@@ ks to get around this oblig@@ ation@@ ," said Pat@@ r@@ ici@@ a S@@ chi@@ ffer@@ le, an environmental consult@@ ant and long@@ time op@@ pon@@ ent of the proposed tun@@ n@@ els.
it ra@@ ises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.
business Grou@@ ps Ap@@ pe@@ al to China Over Cy@@ ber@@ security Law
a co@@ ali@@ tion of international business groups has appe@@ aled to China to change proposed cy@@ ber@@ security rules they war@@ n will har@@ m trade and isol@@ ate the country.
the letter to Chinese Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, refl@@ ecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products.
sign@@ ers include the U.S. Cham@@ ber of Commer@@ ce, the European Services Forum and groups from Jap@@ an, Korea and Mex@@ ic@@ o.
the proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.
the latest let@@ ter, d@@ ated W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day, says that might make data the@@ ft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Ti@@ anj@@ in chemical b@@ la@@ st@@ : dead@@ ly dis@@ aster marked one year on
China's leaders may want mu@@ ted comm@@ em@@ or@@ ations to mark the first an@@ nivers@@ ary of the mas@@ sive chemical bl@@ ast that killed 17@@ 3 people, but not everyone agre@@ es.
almost anywhere else in the world the an@@ nivers@@ ary of a dis@@ aster of this mag@@ nit@@ ude would present a moment of national soul@@ -@@ search@@ ing.
but not in China.
while a mem@@ orial service to some of the dead fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters is being held in the city of Ti@@ anj@@ in, else@@ where the tribu@@ tes are being mu@@ ted.
the Communist Part@@ y-@@ controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survi@@ v@@ ors, as well as family members of the de@@ ad, are being war@@ ned not to speak to the foreign pres@@ s.
but 23@@ -@@ year-@@ old Zh@@ ang M@@ eng@@ fan won't stay qui@@ et.
"@@ on this an@@ nivers@@ ary there should be a way for the public to know what happen@@ ed@@ ," he tells me.
I don't want sil@@ ence.
on 12 August last year, Mr Zh@@ ang was a radio operator with a military fire bri@@ g@@ ad@@ e, st@@ ation@@ ed just a kilomet@@ re from the ep@@ ic@@ entr@@ e of the explo@@ sion@@ s.
"the call came in at 10@@ : 53 that night and we started to des@@ pat@@ ch my team@@ ma@@ te@@ s," he say@@ s.
other cre@@ w@@ s from else@@ where in the city were also arriv@@ ing to t@@ ack@@ le the large fire in a chemical storage de@@ po@@ t.
all of them would have been ob@@ li@@ vious to the fact that large quanti@@ ties of vol@@ ati@@ le and tox@@ ic subst@@ ances were being il@@ leg@@ ally store@@ d, way beyond permitted amoun@@ ts and without proper management.
the fire had started when a bat@@ ch of nit@@ ro@@ cell@@ u@@ lose - a chemical used in n@@ ail pol@@ ish - had been allowed to dry out and then ig@@ ni@@ ted in the summer he@@ at.
it then spread to a huge stoc@@ k@@ p@@ ile - 800 ton@@ n@@ es - of am@@ mon@@ ium nit@@ rate ferti@@ liz@@ er.
the resulting explo@@ sions sh@@ atter@@ ed the windows and brought the ro@@ of in at the fire station where Zh@@ ang M@@ eng@@ fan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scen@@ e.
those reports never came in.
"@@ when I saw the mus@@ h@@ room cloud I fell into a state of des@@ per@@ ation@@ ," he tells me.
I knew what it would mean for my friend@@ s.
of the 26 fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters sent to the b@@ la@@ ze from his unit that night, eight never came back.
many of the others suffer@@ ed serious bur@@ ns and other injur@@ ies.
the biggest of the two large explo@@ sions was measured as a se@@ ism@@ ic ev@@ ent, with a bl@@ ast wave that was felt many kilomet@@ res away.
the total cost of the damage was put at more than $@@ 1@@ b@@ n, including the 300@@ -@@ plus buildings that were destro@@ y@@ ed.
a total of 17@@ 3 people lost their lives - 10@@ 4 of them fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters.
an official government en@@ quir@@ y has laid the bl@@ ame squ@@ are@@ ly at corrup@@ tion, political connections and official coll@@ usion that allowed cor@@ ners to be cut and safety systems to be over@@ rid@@ d@@ en.
the storage de@@ pot should never have been built so close to resid@@ ential buildings in the first place.
more than 100 offici@@ als and company execu@@ tives are facing some kind of discipl@@ inary or criminal investig@@ ation.
so while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of hom@@ es rep@@ aired and the resid@@ ents compens@@ ated - those ling@@ ering sensi@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties remain@@ .
the dis@@ aster has exposed the cr@@ acks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent over@@ sight is a fact of life.
the bra@@ very and sense of duty that night cannot be dou@@ b@@ ted and yet al@@ ong@@ side the image of the fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ter as her@@ o, there is the other un@@ comfortable pic@@ ture.
that of the fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ter as vic@@ tim@@ , sent without proper knowledge into an avo@@ id@@ able, man@@ -@@ made cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ e.
Zh@@ ang M@@ eng@@ fan has now left the fire service but will atten@@ d the mem@@ orial service in Ti@@ anj@@ in.
he will be car@@ rying in his heart a message for his dead com@@ rad@@ es.
what I want to tell them most is this@@ : I've been to visit your parents and they are fin@@ e.
leave your parents to me.
I am a member of your family now.
cold spring could affect Scot@@ tish gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting season
Scot@@ land@@ 's gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting season will begin later, with cold weather h@@ itting bir@@ d numbers this year.
several est@@ ates have post@@ pon@@ ed sho@@ o@@ ting as many of the early ch@@ ic@@ ks did not survi@@ ve the c@@ ool spring conditions.
mar@@ king the start of the seas@@ on, the Scot@@ tish g@@ ame@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s Association (S@@ G@@ A) said gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting sustain@@ ed more jobs than the Edinburgh f@@ esti@@ val@@ s.
but animal protection char@@ ity one@@ kind called for an end to the "@@ br@@ ut@@ al s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ " of the bir@@ ds.
the organis@@ ation@@ 's director Har@@ ry Hu@@ y@@ ton said: "the effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game bir@@ ds for sho@@ o@@ ting is huge and inv@@ ari@@ ably invol@@ ves some extremely contro@@ versi@@ al practic@@ es."
it is not surpris@@ ing the public is turning their back on this so@@ -@@ called s@@ port and calling the government to account on a cru@@ el, un@@ necessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small min@@ ority of people in Scot@@ land.
but land@@ owners ins@@ isted they were committed to conserv@@ ation and that gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting was v@@ ital to the r@@ ural econom@@ y.
the SG@@ A@@ 's ch@@ air@@ man, A@@ lex Ho@@ gg@@ , said the industry supported 8@@ ,@@ 800 full-@@ time jobs per year in remote areas and was a "@@ rich se@@ am of employ@@ ment@@ " in un@@ certain times.
he said: "@@ compared to many other European countries, Scot@@ land does not have an em@@ bedded '@@ hun@@ ting@@ ' culture and ch@@ un@@ ks of the population don't know the impact the sho@@ o@@ ting seas@@ ons have to the country, econom@@ ic@@ all@@ y@@ ."
Mr Ho@@ g@@ g said the number of full-@@ time jobs rel@@ ying on sho@@ o@@ ting exceed@@ ed the posts created by the Edinburgh International F@@ esti@@ val@@ , the Fr@@ ing@@ e, T@@ at@@ too and Ho@@ g@@ man@@ ay comb@@ in@@ ed.
he add@@ ed: "@@ there are real concer@@ ns for employment in r@@ ural Scot@@ land at the moment, particularly in oil and g@@ as, so g@@ ame@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s and their families want to see the industry grow@@ .
we want to work with the Scot@@ tish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.
R@@ SP@@ B Scot@@ land believes that eight gol@@ den e@@ ag@@ les have been killed il@@ leg@@ ally around gr@@ ouse mo@@ ors
many g@@ ame@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s acknowledge that gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting is not univers@@ ally popul@@ ar, but the S@@ GA said the industry had made "@@ significant stri@@ des in terms of best practic@@ e."
the opening day of the gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting season is tra@@ dition@@ ally known as the "@@ Gl@@ ori@@ ous T@@ wel@@ f@@ th@@ ."
however, the s@@ port remains contro@@ versi@@ al and the management of gr@@ ouse sho@@ o@@ ting mo@@ ors has been linked to the per@@ secu@@ tion of rap@@ tors by some w@@ ild@@ life bodi@@ es.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, R@@ SP@@ B Scot@@ land said eight t@@ agged gol@@ den e@@ ag@@ les had dis@@ appeared in the Mon@@ ad@@ h@@ li@@ ath mountain@@ s, sou@@ th-@@ east of In@@ vern@@ ess, in less than five years.
the w@@ ild@@ life char@@ ity believes they were killed il@@ leg@@ ally around gr@@ ouse mo@@ ors and their satellite tracking t@@ ags destro@@ y@@ ed.
Scot@@ tish Environ@@ ment Secretary Ro@@ se@@ ann@@ a C@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ham said the reports were "@@ very dist@@ urb@@ ing and dis@@ appoin@@ ting@@ ."
M@@ s C@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ham has ordered offici@@ als to analy@@ se the evidence of about 90 survi@@ ving and missing e@@ ag@@ les with the tag@@ s, to determine if there is a pattern of susp@@ icious activ@@ ity.
the Scot@@ tish mo@@ or@@ land Group acc@@ used the R@@ SP@@ B of trying to wh@@ ip up anti-@@ sho@@ o@@ ting feel@@ ings ahead of the gr@@ ouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the bir@@ ds having even died in the Mon@@ ad@@ h@@ li@@ ath area.

pro@@ be after mass failure of In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ H@@ I course
an entire class of 20 students may have fail@@ ed a High@@ er Media course run by In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ H@@ I.
most of those on the course were 17 and 18@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds ho@@ ping to use their mark from their studies to go to univers@@ ity.
In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ H@@ I said quality ass@@ ur@@ ance processes were in place, adding that the Scot@@ tish Qu@@ ali@@ fic@@ ations Authority (S@@ Q@@ A) was investig@@ ating.
a spo@@ k@@ es@@ man for the SQ@@ A said the nation@@ all@@ y-@@ available 2016 High@@ er Media assess@@ ment had "@@ performed as inten@@ d@@ ed@@ ."
tw@@ enty students signed up for the In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ HI@@ -@@ run and marked course.
many of the students were young people in r@@ ural areas who received tui@@ tion on@@ line, but also had to make frequ@@ ent vis@@ its to the college in In@@ ver@@ ness from where they lived in places such as Lo@@ ch@@ ab@@ er.
a father of one of the students said that, following post@@ ings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work.
he told B@@ BC News Scot@@ land online that about five other people who sat the same course at In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ H@@ I last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.
the situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of G@@ las@@ g@@ ow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of quali@@ fic@@ ations she g@@ ained at scho@@ ol.
but her father said there were others who did the col@@ leg@@ e-@@ run media course who were less fortun@@ ate and were now "@@ in lim@@ bo@@ " and un@@ sure if their course work would be re-@@ exam@@ ined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university plac@@ es.
In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ H@@ I is part of the University of the High@@ lands and Is@@ land@@ s.
Di@@ ane R@@ aw@@ lin@@ son, princip@@ al and chief executive at In@@ ver@@ ness College U@@ H@@ I, said: "@@ we take ex@@ am results and student success very seri@@ ous@@ ly@@ ."
this is evid@@ enc@@ ed by the excellent H@@ M@@ I@@ E report we received earlier this year as well as the year-@@ on-@@ year improve@@ ments to at@@ tainment levels we have achieved in both Fur@@ ther and High@@ er educ@@ ation.
as we do every year, we are under@@ taking a review of all published resul@@ ts, compar@@ ing them against those projec@@ ted for each stud@@ ent.
in the case of this particular course, the usual quality ass@@ ur@@ ance processes were in place and the award@@ ing body veri@@ fier recently reported '@@ significant streng@@ ths in the delivery and management of this award@@ ' and confirm@@ ed that '@@ assess@@ ment jud@@ ge@@ ments were consistent with the national standards set@@ '@@ .
SQ@@ A are currently investig@@ ating this matter at our request.
a spo@@ k@@ es@@ man for the SQ@@ A said: "@@ we are happy that the 2016 High@@ er Media assess@@ ment performed as intended and it provided can@@ di@@ dates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subjec@@ t.
many can@@ di@@ dates performed strong@@ ly and we saw a s@@ light increase in the A-@@ C at@@ tainment rate compared to the same quali@@ fication last year.
it was designed in line with past and ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ar papers and according to our course and assess@@ ment specific@@ ations.
bro@@ thers j@@ ail@@ ed for sam@@ ur@@ ai s@@ word '@@ bloo@@ d@@ bath@@ ' in K@@ il@@ mar@@ no@@ ck
J@@ as@@ on B@@ ry@@ den was attack@@ ed with a sam@@ ur@@ ai s@@ wor@@ d, k@@ ni@@ fe and n@@ un@@ ch@@ uc@@ ks
two bro@@ thers have been j@@ ail@@ ed for k@@ illing a man with a sam@@ ur@@ ai s@@ word after a dru@@ g@@ s-@@ related rob@@ ber@@ y in East Ay@@ r@@ sh@@ ire turned into a "@@ bloo@@ d@@ bath@@ ."
the vic@@ tim@@ , J@@ as@@ on B@@ ry@@ d@@ en, 3@@ 8, was repe@@ ated@@ ly st@@ ab@@ bed during the attack at his home in K@@ il@@ mar@@ no@@ ck on 5 July 201@@ 5.
at the High Court in G@@ las@@ g@@ ow, James Clar@@ k, 36@@ , was j@@ ail@@ ed for a least 22 years after being con@@ vic@@ ted of mur@@ der.
his brother Joh@@ n, 3@@ 8, was j@@ ail@@ ed for 10 years after being con@@ vic@@ ted of the less@@ er charge of cul@@ p@@ able hom@@ ic@@ id@@ e.
j@@ ail@@ ing both men, jud@@ ge B@@ ill D@@ un@@ lo@@ p told the bro@@ thers that they had carried out "@@ a mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess, rel@@ ent@@ less and sav@@ age attack@@ ."
he rejec@@ ted any sugges@@ tion that Mr B@@ ry@@ den had been lay@@ ing in wait for them armed with a sam@@ ur@@ ai s@@ wor@@ d.
jud@@ ge D@@ un@@ lo@@ p add@@ ed: "@@ you together plan@@ ned to gain illegal access with at least one k@@ ni@@ fe and n@@ un@@ ch@@ uck@@ s.
J@@ as@@ on B@@ ry@@ den may have been a drug deal@@ er but he was a son, a father and a friend@@ .
he was but@@ ch@@ ered by you.
after both men were j@@ ail@@ ed, D@@ et In@@ s@@ p David Mor@@ an, who led the investig@@ ation, said: "the viol@@ ent and terri@@ ble actions of John and James Clar@@ k caused the death of J@@ as@@ on B@@ ry@@ den@@ ."
to be taken at the age of 3@@ 8, in such hor@@ ri@@ fying circumst@@ ances, is a heart@@ bre@@ aking situation that the family has been forced to end@@ ure.
the court previously heard the bro@@ ther@@ s, from K@@ il@@ mar@@ no@@ c@@ k, had decided to ro@@ b Mr B@@ ry@@ den of a gold br@@ ac@@ el@@ et which they had given to him in exchange for dru@@ g@@ s.
the p@@ air, who were high on drink and dru@@ g@@ s, went to his home after mas@@ king their faces with sc@@ ar@@ ves and arm@@ ing themselves with a k@@ ni@@ fe and mar@@ ti@@ al arts n@@ un@@ ch@@ uck@@ s.
neigh@@ bour@@ s said they could see the Clar@@ ks att@@ acking Mr B@@ ry@@ den as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him scre@@ am@@ ing.
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or Ric@@ hard God@@ d@@ ard told the tri@@ al: "@@ this was a sustain@@ ed, f@@ ren@@ zi@@ ed attack on this man@@ ."
after@@ ward@@ s, the scen@@ e of the k@@ illing was described as a "@@ bloo@@ d@@ bath@@ ."
in addition to the st@@ ab w@@ ound@@ s, Mr B@@ ry@@ den suffer@@ ed bl@@ un@@ t force tra@@ um@@ a during the ass@@ a@@ ul@@ t.
he died in K@@ il@@ mar@@ no@@ ck@@ 's Cro@@ s@@ sh@@ ouse Hosp@@ ital three days lat@@ er.
in evid@@ ence, James Clar@@ k, who has 38 previous con@@ vic@@ tions including one for attemp@@ ted mur@@ der, said: "I didn't mean it. it was an accid@@ ent@@ ."
John Clar@@ k, who has 23 previous con@@ vic@@ tions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claim@@ ed was being attack@@ ed by Mr B@@ ry@@ d@@ en.
man j@@ ail@@ ed for sha@@ king and k@@ illing his baby son
David S@@ incl@@ air ad@@ mitted k@@ illing the child at his home in East K@@ il@@ bri@@ de in 2012
a man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of r@@ age because he would not feed has been j@@ ail@@ ed for seven years and three month@@ s.
David S@@ incl@@ air shook four@@ -@@ month@@ -@@ old Jo@@ sh@@ ua in a "@@ moment@@ ary loss of control@@ " at their home in East K@@ il@@ bri@@ de, South Lan@@ ar@@ k@@ shi@@ re, on 6 December 201@@ 2.
the cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical exper@@ ts.
S@@ incl@@ air, 3@@ 4, was origin@@ ally charged with mur@@ der but ple@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ il@@ ty to the less@@ er charge of cul@@ p@@ able hom@@ ic@@ id@@ e.
j@@ ail@@ ing him at the High Court in G@@ las@@ g@@ ow, jud@@ ge Lord Br@@ ac@@ ad@@ ale told S@@ incl@@ air@@ : "@@ you ass@@ a@@ ul@@ ted your baby son by sha@@ king him, ca@@ using the injur@@ ies which killed him@@ ."
you must have known at the time you had sha@@ ken him, but you did not disclose that.
it was only after extensive medical investig@@ ations you ad@@ mitted what you had don@@ e.
your wife believed in you.
she now fe@@ els she had been mis@@ led by you and can no longer support you.
Lord Br@@ ac@@ ad@@ ale described the effects of Jo@@ shu@@ a's death as "@@ cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ " for all concerned and add@@ ed: "@@ nothing can bring Jo@@ sh@@ ua back@@ ."
the court previously heard that that on the day the child di@@ ed, S@@ incl@@ air and his wife Kir@@ st@@ y had gone swimming with Jo@@ sh@@ ua and then shopping in East K@@ il@@ bri@@ de.
at 17@@ : 30 Kir@@ st@@ y S@@ incl@@ air went out to meet her mother and sist@@ er.
just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from S@@ incl@@ air, who s@@ ounded "@@ sho@@ ck@@ ed@@ ."
he told her@@ : "@@ Jo@@ sh@@ ua isn't breath@@ ing proper@@ ly, come home right away@@ ."
he then h@@ ung up and di@@ all@@ ed 99@@ 9.

Vi@@ j@@ ay Go@@ el, pic@@ tured in J@@ ul@@ y, has def@@ ended his behavi@@ our@@ .
on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day, Olympic organiz@@ ers thre@@ ate@@ ned to with@@ draw Go@@ el@@ 's acc@@ red@@ itation if the behavior did not impro@@ ve, sending a war@@ ning letter after he and his ent@@ our@@ age tried to enter restric@@ ted areas in the g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics venue and the aren@@ a where f@@ enc@@ ing and ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do is hel@@ d.
"@@ we have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter acc@@ redi@@ ted areas at venu@@ es with un@@ acc@@ redi@@ ted individu@@ al@@ s," Sar@@ ah Pet@@ er@@ son, contin@@ ental manager of the Rio 2016 Organ@@ izing Committee wrote in the no@@ te.
when the staff tried to explain that this is not allow@@ ed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become agg@@ res@@ sive and r@@ ude and sometimes pushed past our staff@@ .
"@@ should our proto@@ col team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavi@@ or, the acc@@ red@@ itation of your Minister for Sports will be canc@@ elled and his privileg@@ es at the Olympic Games withdraw@@ n@@ ," the letter continu@@ ed.
the leader of the Indian dele@@ gation called the matter "@@ a non-@@ issue being made an issu@@ e" and Go@@ el himself said he had done nothing wr@@ ong, ch@@ al@@ king it up to a "@@ mis@@ understand@@ ing@@ ."

DE@@ A@@ 's mis@@ sed opportunity on medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana
the answer s@@ ad@@ ly is@@ : un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
and this is a mis@@ sed opportunity that could further delay potential therap@@ ies to coun@@ t@@ less people.
up until to@@ day, there has been only one fed@@ er@@ ally approved source of research@@ -@@ grade medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana, at the University of Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i.
in a bit of seem@@ ingly positive news to@@ day, the DE@@ A also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
the hope is that mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and di@@ vers@@ ity.
while this will be ha@@ iled as a vic@@ tory for resear@@ ch, it will larg@@ ely be sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ ic, because no matter how much mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana is available, if access is still difficul@@ t, it hard@@ ly mat@@ ters.
imag@@ ine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a loc@@ ked door.
in response to the demand for the product, someone makes a b@@ aff@@ ling decision to make more of it but still never un@@ loc@@ ks the door.
mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana is that product, and its Sch@@ ed@@ ule I design@@ ation is that loc@@ ked door.
that is the predic@@ ament of medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ an@@ a.
because mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana is a Sch@@ ed@@ ule I subst@@ ance (@@ meaning that by definition it has "@@ no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for ab@@ use@@ "@@ ), there are significant hur@@ d@@ les to getting the door un@@ lock@@ ed.
potential research@@ ers typically go to the DE@@ A first, as it grants the license to begin scientific resear@@ ch.
even if a license is gr@@ ante@@ d, to study a Sch@@ ed@@ ule I subst@@ ance, institutions must have heav@@ y-@@ duty saf@@ es and high-@@ grade security systems inst@@ alle@@ d, which can be exp@@ ensi@@ ve.
there is also the more subjec@@ tive consideration of getting approval from your academic institu@@ tion to do the research on a Sch@@ ed@@ ule I status subst@@ ance in the first place.
even if individual fac@@ ul@@ ty members want to do that resear@@ ch, the university leadership may not want the h@@ ass@@ le or the potential fall@@ out of bad pres@@ s.
this happened at the University of Ari@@ z@@ ona when Dr. S@@ ue S@@ is@@ ley was let go after trying to pursu@@ e a medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana tri@@ al.
S@@ is@@ ley event@@ ually had to find private fun@@ ding for her projec@@ t, and just in A@@ pr@@ il, seven years after the study was initi@@ ally propos@@ ed, h@@ ers became the first DE@@ A approved medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana tri@@ al for post@@ -@@ tra@@ um@@ atic stress in v@@ eter@@ ans.
then, after years of bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ r@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les, it is the National Institute on D@@ ru@@ g Ab@@ use that has held the final key to the loc@@ k.
to@@ day, it is the biggest fed@@ eral public fun@@ der of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana research and has been the sole supplier of the mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana itself.
even if more medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana will now be fre@@ ed up for resear@@ ch, the in@@ stitute will still have to appro@@ ve any studies it fun@@ ds.
the proble@@ m, however, is that last word in its name: "@@ ab@@ use@@ ."
according to Dr. Don@@ ald A@@ br@@ ams at the University of San Franc@@ is@@ co, whom I inter@@ viewed for my docu@@ mentary "@@ We@@ ed@@ ," the in@@ stitute has a primary mand@@ ate to study subst@@ ances for potential ab@@ use rather than as a medic@@ ine.
A@@ br@@ ams makes an important poin@@ t.
even if a study does cross all the hur@@ d@@ les described above, the door may stay loc@@ ked if the in@@ tent is to study the benefits of medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana as op@@ posed to the harm@@ .
consider this@@ : a quick (and ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly non-@@ scienti@@ fic@@ ) search through the U.S. National Library of Medic@@ ine pulled up 1,@@ 4@@ 34 papers on medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana over the past five years.
that same search reve@@ aled only 57 papers on medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana benef@@ its.
the vast majority were research into the har@@ m of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana, such as "@@ B@@ ad trip due to anti@@ ch@@ ol@@ in@@ er@@ gi@@ c effect of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is@@ ," "@@ C@@ ann@@ ab@@ is induc@@ ed pan@@ cre@@ ati@@ ti@@ ts@@ " and "@@ Mari@@ ju@@ ana use and risk of l@@ ung canc@@ er@@ ."
that im@@ balance pain@@ ts a highly di@@ stor@@ ted pic@@ ture.
the road to medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana research is p@@ av@@ ed with surpris@@ es and hypo@@ cris@@ y nearly every@@ where you loo@@ k.
while the DE@@ A continues to di@@ g in on Sch@@ ed@@ ule I stat@@ us, deem@@ ing no medical benef@@ it, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simul@@ tane@@ ously holds a patent on c@@ ann@@ ab@@ ino@@ ids for a wide range of medic@@ inal purpos@@ es.
the DE@@ A continues to place mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana al@@ ong@@ side her@@ o@@ in and LS@@ D as dru@@ gs with high ab@@ use potential even though the DE@@ A@@ 's own former chief administrative law judg@@ e, Franc@@ is Y@@ oun@@ g, dis@@ agreed with this.
in strict medical terms mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana is far saf@@ er than many foo@@ ds we commonly consum@@ e.
for example, eating 10 raw pot@@ ato@@ es can result in a tox@@ ic respon@@ se.
by compar@@ is@@ on, it is phys@@ ically impossible to eat enough mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana to induc@@ e death@@ .
by any measure of r@@ ational analysis mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana can be saf@@ ely used within the supervis@@ ed rou@@ t@@ ine of medical care@@ .
again, that was from a jud@@ ge with the DE@@ A itself.
and yet nearly 30 years later, little has chang@@ ed.
whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y in our daily liv@@ es.
may@@ be we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too spe@@ ech@@ less and d@@ umb@@ founded that no one else seems to have notic@@ ed.
with regard to the hypo@@ cris@@ y of fed@@ eral medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana polic@@ y, however, it is worth sum@@ mon@@ ing the st@@ am@@ ina to rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ly present the fac@@ ts.
the lives of patients -- such as that of Char@@ lot@@ te Fig@@ i, whose se@@ iz@@ ures ab@@ ated with the use of medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana, and so many others -- dep@@ end on it.
that a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these loc@@ ked doors is worth speaking up ab@@ out.

M@@ um@@ in S@@ ah@@ in and Em@@ in O@@ z@@ men were found gu@@ il@@ ty after a tri@@ al at the High Court in G@@ las@@ go@@ w after three ton@@ n@@ es of the Class A drug were discovered inside the M@@ V Ham@@ al about 100 miles off the co@@ ast of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en.
the 2015 se@@ iz@@ ure is said to be the biggest single co@@ ca@@ ine ha@@ u@@ l ever recover@@ ed at sea in Europ@@ e.
M@@ um@@ in S@@ ah@@ in and Em@@ in O@@ z@@ men have been j@@ ail@@ ed for their role in a huge drug deal
the mas@@ sive ha@@ u@@ l of dru@@ gs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history
the dru@@ gs were found hidden in a speci@@ all@@ y-@@ adap@@ ted secret hold in the T@@ anz@@ ani@@ an-@@ registered tu@@ g@@ bo@@ at, which was sailing from Istan@@ bu@@ l to T@@ ener@@ i@@ fe and then to the North Se@@ a.
it was stopped by the Royal Nav@@ y fri@@ gate H@@ MS Som@@ er@@ set and B@@ order Force cut@@ ter H@@ M@@ C V@@ ali@@ ant.
S@@ ah@@ in, 4@@ 7, was sen@@ ten@@ c@@ ed to 22 years while O@@ z@@ men, 5@@ 1, was hand@@ ed down a 20@@ -@@ year term at the High Court in G@@ las@@ g@@ ow@@ .
jud@@ ge Lord K@@ incl@@ av@@ en told the men the quanti@@ ty of dru@@ gs was@@ ' not only significant but mas@@ sive '@@ and dru@@ gs traff@@ ic@@ king had a@@ ' dev@@ ast@@ ating impact '@@ on people and comm@@ uni@@ ties.
he said: '@@ you were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale invol@@ ving the transportation of co@@ ca@@ ine by ship, in an operation which cross@@ ed international and inde@@ ed inter@@ contin@@ ental bound@@ ari@@ es.@@ '
he told the ship@@ 's cap@@ tain S@@ ah@@ in, he was@@ ' not at the top of the dru@@ gs tree '@@ but had played an important role in the off@@ ence, while second cap@@ tain O@@ z@@ men@@ 's role was@@ ' to some extent a less@@ er one '@@ .
offic@@ ers board@@ ed the Ham@@ al following a ti@@ p-@@ off from French custom@@ s body DN@@ RE@@ D, and once it was doc@@ ked in A@@ ber@@ de@@ en they dr@@ illed through a steel plate into a secret com@@ part@@ ment to find 12@@ 8 bal@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine weigh@@ ing 3.@@ 2 ton@@ n@@ es, with an estimated street value of £@@ 5@@ 12 milli@@ on.
M@@ V Ham@@ al was board@@ ed by the Royal Nav@@ y last year.
three ton@@ n@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine was onboard
ton@@ n@@ es of the Class@@ -@@ A drug were cr@@ am@@ med in the ship@@ 's ball@@ ast tank when it was ra@@ id@@ ed
the ship went from the Bo@@ s@@ por@@ us to South America before being stopped in the North Sea
the entry to the space was found under a ward@@ robe in one of the cre@@ w@@ 's quar@@ ters, with the opening ce@@ mented over@@ .
S@@ ah@@ in and O@@ z@@ men were found gu@@ il@@ ty of being concerned with the car@@ rying and conc@@ eal@@ ing of co@@ ca@@ ine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of co@@ ca@@ ine between April 21 and April 23@@ .
the men, both first off@@ end@@ ers who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving scho@@ ol, continue to maintain their in@@ no@@ c@@ ence but accept the jur@@ y's ver@@ dic@@ t.
charges against four other men were found not pro@@ ven@@ .
S@@ ah@@ in@@ 's law@@ y@@ er, J@@ on@@ ath@@ an C@@ row@@ e, said the married father@@ -@@ of-@@ two was a '@@ gl@@ ori@@ fied mu@@ le@@ '@@ .
he said: '@@ someone who was involved in the transportation of the dru@@ g@@ s.@@ '
in regard to the dru@@ gs hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y, Mr S@@ ah@@ in is certainly not at the top of the dru@@ gs tree but some@@ where further down.
the she@@ er amount of co@@ ca@@ ine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a cran@@ e
police spent days going through the boat before the dru@@ gs were divided into these box@@ es
S@@ ah@@ in was appro@@ ached about cap@@ taining the Ham@@ al in February 2015, the court he@@ ard.
Mr Cro@@ we said he is@@ ' dev@@ ast@@ ated '@@ about missing out on mil@@ est@@ ones for his daugh@@ ter, n@@ ine, and son, 13, and@@ ' just wants to go home to Tur@@ key '@@ .
both men have not seen their families since being taken into c@@ ust@@ od@@ y in April 2015 as their families stru@@ ggle to get visa appro@@ val@@ .
O@@ z@@ men@@ 's law@@ y@@ er, Di Moo@@ re, said he is@@ ' des@@ per@@ ate '@@ to see his family but knows that will@@ ' remain impossible '@@ for the fo@@ res@@ ee@@ able future.
speaking following today's sen@@ ten@@ c@@ ing, Scot@@ land@@ 's C@@ row@@ n Ag@@ ent pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or David Har@@ vi@@ e said: '@@ the international dru@@ gs trade does not respect b@@ ord@@ ers, and those of us whose job it is to dis@@ man@@ tle it are working ever@@ -@@ closer together to ensure we stay one step a@@ head.
'@@ sco@@ t@@ land@@ 's reach in pursu@@ ing crimin@@ als is on a truly global scale and in this case we have deal@@ t a substanti@@ al economic b@@ low to organ@@ ised crimin@@ al@@ s.@@ '
dru@@ gs were pack@@ ed into every c@@ av@@ ity in the bo@@ at, including under the floors
this package of contr@@ ab@@ and was found hidden in the ship@@ 's laundry room by offic@@ ers
Mr Har@@ vi@@ e add@@ ed: '@@ the Ham@@ al was identified after an intellig@@ ence ti@@ p-@@ off from French authori@@ ties, and s@@ wi@@ ft co-@@ operation from the At@@ tor@@ ney General in T@@ anz@@ ania where the ship was registered allowed it to be board@@ ed.
'@@ our investig@@ ation then stret@@ ched from Gu@@ y@@ ana, who provided access to cruc@@ ial shipping record@@ s, to Spain, who gave us cruc@@ ial information on the ship@@ 's stop@@ -@@ off@@ s in the Can@@ ary Is@@ land@@ s.
we also worked with col@@ leagu@@ es in Den@@ mark, Nor@@ way and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together.
despite strong intellig@@ ence that the Ham@@ al was car@@ rying a large volume of dru@@ g@@ s, it could not be board@@ ed in international wat@@ ers by the UK authorities without the permission of the T@@ anz@@ an@@ ian government - something they had never previously gr@@ ante@@ d.

under international mar@@ i@@ time law, the UK cannot board a ves@@ sel in international wat@@ ers which is under the f@@ lag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so.

L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire father ban@@ ned from children@@ 's school after wearing T-@@ sh@@ irt with swe@@ ar word
a father@@ -@@ of-@@ two has been ban@@ ned from his children@@ 's school for turning up at their sports day in an off@@ ensive T-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t.
Cr@@ ai@@ g Mc@@ Be@@ th, 36@@ , from Bur@@ n@@ le@@ y, in L@@ anc@@ as@@ hi@@ re, says he '@@ accid@@ ent@@ all@@ y@@ ' wor@@ e the top with the s@@ log@@ an "@@ Let's get out there and t * * t it '@@ .
but despite ap@@ olog@@ ising when he real@@ ised his error and turning the T-@@ sh@@ irt inside out, the next day he discovered he was bar@@ red from the school ground@@ s.
the single fa@@ ther, who had been a govern@@ or for four years at Park Pri@@ mary Scho@@ ol, in Col@@ ne, Bur@@ n@@ le@@ y, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the polic@@ e.
Cr@@ ai@@ g Mc@@ Be@@ th, 36@@ , from Bur@@ n@@ ley says he was bar@@ red from the school grounds after wearing this off@@ ensive T-@@ sh@@ irt to his children@@ 's sports day
Mr Bur@@ n@@ ley has acc@@ used head teacher Sar@@ ah Mid@@ g@@ ely of over@@ re@@ act@@ ing.
he said he is being un@@ fair@@ ly pun@@ ished for mistak@@ en@@ ly putting on the T-@@ sh@@ irt in a r@@ ush before going to watch his two children compe@@ te.
the d@@ ad, who has now qu@@ it as a school govern@@ or, said: "@@ it was a mistak@@ e, and an over@@ sight on my par@@ t.
I was not thinking about sports day and r@@ ush@@ ing when I put it on.
towards the end of the event we were having a father@@ 's race and the head teacher noticed my T-@@ sh@@ irt and said it was not appropri@@ ate.
I ap@@ olog@@ ised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the mat@@ ter.
but the 36@@ -@@ year-@@ old said he received an email from the ch@@ air@@ man of govern@@ ors later that evening as@@ king him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already ap@@ olog@@ is@@ ed.
"the head@@ teacher then phon@@ ed me and said I was bar@@ red from the school pre@@ mis@@ es@@ ," added Mr Bur@@ n@@ le@@ y,
I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a f@@ us@@ s about it and that got a lot of people inter@@ es@@ ted.
any righ@@ t-@@ min@@ ded person would think this was an over@@ re@@ action.
Mr Mc@@ Be@@ th, who is the editor of an online magaz@@ ine called Love Min@@ i, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of ter@@ m, because of the ban@@ .
but this promp@@ ted a phone call from the school and social services.
the t-@@ sh@@ irt had a picture of Cr@@ ai@@ g Char@@ les@@ 's character L@@ ister from the cul@@ t B@@ BC com@@ edy Red D@@ war@@ f with one of his icon@@ ic lines - '@@ Let's go out and t * * t it@@ .'
he commen@@ ted@@ : "I told them I was not there because they had ban@@ ned me from the scho@@ ol.
I then got a phone call from social services as@@ king why I had not pic@@ ked my daughter up.
the school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.
Mr Mc@@ B@@ eth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school pre@@ mis@@ es and the pro@@ hibition will continue until further notice.
he says he was also war@@ ned he could face a fine of £@@ 500 if found t@@ resp@@ ass@@ ing.
Sar@@ ah Mid@@ g@@ le@@ y, head@@ teacher at Park Pri@@ mary Scho@@ ol, said this matter is now closed
Sar@@ ah Mid@@ g@@ le@@ y, head@@ teacher at Park Pri@@ mary Scho@@ ol, said: "I can confirm that Mr Mc@@ B@@ eth has re@@ signed and is no longer a govern@@ or at our scho@@ ol.
this matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in Septem@@ ber.
Bur@@ n@@ ley coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Jo@@ e Co@@ on@@ ey said the school had clear policies and guidelin@@ es.
"@@ we all have to bear in mind when you take on these ro@@ les such as a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or or govern@@ or you are held to a higher standard and un@@ fortun@@ ately this time he has not met that standard@@ ," he said.
Counc@@ ill@@ or J@@ on@@ ath@@ an Ni@@ x@@ on added he did not think the school should have ban@@ ned him and the situation had been b@@ low@@ n out of pro@@ por@@ tion.
Mr Ni@@ x@@ on add@@ ed: "@@ he was st@@ up@@ id to wear the T-@@ sh@@ irt and he ap@@ olog@@ ised at the tim@@ e."
L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire Pol@@ ice confirm@@ ed they were called by the scho@@ ol, but did not atten@@ d.
6@@ 5% of Venez@@ u@@ el@@ ans want to ou@@ st Mad@@ uro@@ , the question is if they are w@@ illing to fight for it
two out of three Venez@@ u@@ el@@ ans want to re@@ vo@@ ke President Nic@@ ol@@ as Mad@@ uro@@ , but the question seems to be whether or not they are w@@ illing to fight for it.
the day after the National Elec@@ tor@@ al Board announced that there is "@@ no tim@@ e" for the rec@@ all vote to take place this year - sec@@ uring Cha@@ vis@@ mo@@ 's gri@@ p of power until 201@@ 9 - people in Car@@ ac@@ as went about their day as if nothing had happen@@ ed.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olymp@@ ics and how Michael P@@ helps won two more med@@ al@@ s," said R@@ af@@ a@@ el De@@ y@@ an, a 36@@ -@@ year-@@ old office cl@@ er@@ k taking a break in Al@@ t@@ am@@ ira Square on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day.
Al@@ t@@ am@@ ira Squ@@ are, located in the east of Car@@ ac@@ as, was the ep@@ ic@@ enter in early 2014 of fi@@ er@@ ce ri@@ o@@ ts pro@@ testing against Mad@@ uro@@ 's regim@@ e.
yet now, when the op@@ position needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the refer@@ end@@ um happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energ@@ y.
"I want a refer@@ end@@ um, but I won't pro@@ test for security reason@@ s," said De@@ y@@ an.
others, more inform@@ ed, are w@@ illing to mobil@@ ize in the future but ad@@ mit Venez@@ u@@ el@@ ans are less mo@@ tiv@@ ated.
elec@@ tor@@ al board president Ti@@ b@@ is@@ ay Luc@@ en@@ a's comments prove that the government is h@@ ind@@ ering the rec@@ all process.
I will pro@@ test when@@ ever the op@@ position calls for a prote@@ st, but I know that some of my friends are sc@@ are@@ d, "@@ Rob@@ erto Re@@ y@@ es, 60@@ , told Fo@@ x News Lat@@ in@@ o.
so on top to the many bar@@ ri@@ ers the government has raised to delay the refer@@ end@@ um, the op@@ position now faces another challeng@@ e: mo@@ tiv@@ ating people to go out to the stre@@ ets and pro@@ test@@ .
until recently the refer@@ end@@ um initi@@ ative had plenty of support - people moved in un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented numbers during the collection of sign@@ at@@ ures phas@@ e.
but when it comes to pro@@ testing against the govern@@ ment@@ 's man@@ eu@@ vers to block the effor@@ t, tur@@ n@@ out at r@@ al@@ lies have been os@@ ten@@ si@@ bly low@@ .
"@@ some people are focused in making food lin@@ es, while others are sc@@ ared after the many ar@@ re@@ sts and death@@ s in 201@@ 4@@ ," said C@@ ip@@ ri@@ ano Her@@ e@@ di@@ a, a law@@ maker for the op@@ posi@@ tion.
after Luc@@ ena announced that the next step in the refer@@ end@@ um process - gather yet more sign@@ at@@ ures countr@@ y@@ wide - would have to wait until Octo@@ ber, those op@@ posed to the soci@@ alist government claim President Mad@@ ur@@ o and his ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are just trying to dis@@ cour@@ age Venez@@ u@@ el@@ ans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but im@@ possible.
according to the Con@@ stitu@@ tion, if the refer@@ end@@ um were to be held in 201@@ 7, Mad@@ ur@@ o could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a success@@ or.
if he were ous@@ ted this year, however, he is mand@@ ated to call for a general elec@@ tion.
the U.S. Department of State addres@@ sed the issue in a statement Th@@ urs@@ day afterno@@ on, calling on the Venez@@ u@@ el@@ an authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitu@@ tional rights of the Venez@@ u@@ el@@ an people.
"the remaining steps for the real@@ ization of the Presid@@ ential Rec@@ all Re@@ fer@@ end@@ um need to be pursu@@ ed clear@@ ly, con@@ cre@@ tely and without del@@ ay, and thus contribu@@ te to the quick and effective resolution of the current poli@@ tic@@ al, economic and social difficul@@ ties in the countr@@ y@@ ," it read@@ .
Lu@@ is Sal@@ am@@ anc@@ a, a political analy@@ st who was a member of the Elec@@ tor@@ al Board between 2006 and 200@@ 9, said change is not likely any@@ time so@@ on.
"I think that there will not be a refer@@ end@@ um this year, unless the social un@@ rest and prote@@ sts grow much more@@ ," he told F@@ N@@ L@@ .
he said that in his view Luc@@ ena and the government are bre@@ aking the law, but they may ul@@ ti@@ mately achieve their goal if people don't pro@@ test l@@ oud enough@@ .
the op@@ position has called for a big r@@ ally on Sep@@ t. 1st in Car@@ ac@@ as to demand a spe@@ ed@@ -up of the process so the rec@@ all can take place this year.
we want people from all over the country to mobil@@ ize to the capital city on that day.
the government will feel the pressu@@ re, "@@ Her@@ e@@ dia said.
but Sal@@ am@@ anc@@ a thin@@ ks that the situation can't wait that long@@ .
"@@ they should have a quick@@ er and strong@@ er response to Luc@@ en@@ a's announc@@ ement because it practic@@ ally k@@ ills the refer@@ end@@ um@@ ," the expert told F@@ N@@ L@@ .
Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Her@@ e@@ dia ad@@ mitted that some parties inside the op@@ position are push@@ ing to make the r@@ ally so@@ on@@ er, but other groups pre@@ fer to have more time to organiz@@ e.
the op@@ position has to be careful now.
if people get dis@@ cour@@ aged by the situation there is a risk of low tur@@ n@@ out in the second round of sign@@ ature peti@@ tion, "@@ said Sal@@ am@@ anc@@ a.
the refer@@ end@@ um process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the countr@@ y's elec@@ tor@@ ate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activ@@ ated.
Sal@@ am@@ anc@@ a and other analy@@ sts are confid@@ ent that even if the rec@@ all takes place on 201@@ 7, Cha@@ vis@@ mo will be hur@@ t.
but some are not that optim@@ istic@@ .
our party wants political change this year.
"@@ if the government clo@@ ses down the elec@@ tor@@ al path@@ , we will have to explore other legal op@@ tion@@ s," Her@@ e@@ dia told F@@ N@@ L@@ .
Premier Le@@ ague 2016-@@ 17 pre@@ views No@@ 19 West B@@ rom@@ w@@ ich Al@@ bi@@ on
gu@@ ardi@@ an writ@@ ers "@@ predic@@ ted position 14@@ th (N@@ B@@ : this is not necess@@ arily Al@@ an S@@ mi@@ th@@ 's predic@@ tion but the average of our writ@@ ers@@ " ti@@ p@@ s)
last seas@@ on's position 14@@ th
od@@ ds to win the le@@ ague (@@ via O@@ d@@ d@@ s@@ chec@@ ker@@ ) 1,@@ 000@@ -@@ 1
until last week it looked like a case of new seas@@ on, same old West B@@ rom@@ w@@ ich Al@@ bi@@ on@@ : 2016-@@ 17 would be another campa@@ ign of comfort - or st@@ ag@@ nation depending on how emp@@ ty the glass is - under the ever@@ -@@ pr@@ ag@@ m@@ atic T@@ ony Pul@@ is.
but then Jer@@ em@@ y Peace sold his 88@@ % st@@ ake in the club to Gu@@ o@@ ch@@ u@@ an L@@ ai and Pul@@ is, the arch@@ et@@ yp@@ al safe pair of hands, was immediately made the book@@ makers "@@ favourite in the ever un@@ pleasant market of first manager to be fi@@ red.
the land@@ scape has und@@ eni@@ ably al@@ tered in the Black Country - and not just at The Haw@@ thor@@ n@@ s, but a few miles nor@@ th-@@ west in Wol@@ ver@@ h@@ amp@@ ton, too, where new Chinese owners was@@ ted no time in reli@@ ev@@ ing K@@ enn@@ y Jack@@ et@@ t of his services.
Pul@@ is, however, has been given re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ances by L@@ ai that his job is not in immedi@@ ate thre@@ at, and the entreprene@@ ur has also stated his desire not to al@@ ter the club cul@@ ture.
"I have no wish to change the club@@ 's e@@ tho@@ s or embar@@ k on an un@@ sustainable sp@@ ending sp@@ re@@ e@@ ," he said upon taking over@@ .
I want to be a good owner and to inv@@ est in this club for the long ter@@ m.
first and fore@@ mo@@ st, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier Le@@ ague and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the di@@ vision@@ .
I believe it is the best le@@ ague in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.
such is Pul@@ is@@ 's record@@ , the first aspect should not be too proble@@ m@@ atic@@ .
the next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided f@@ an@@ base ho@@ ping for a quick sho@@ ot up the table to real@@ ise that is an increasingly on@@ erous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid@@ -@@ table sid@@ es.
to progress from last seas@@ on's 14@@ th-@@ place fin@@ ish will certainly require more of an edge up fron@@ t.
only A@@ ston Vill@@ a, tail@@ ed off at the bott@@ om, sco@@ red fe@@ w@@ er go@@ als and it is worth rec@@ all@@ ing that at Christmas Al@@ bi@@ on were a@@ ver@@ aging fe@@ w@@ er than a shot on target per 90 minute@@ s, by some stret@@ ch the di@@ vision@@ 's wor@@ st.
they fail@@ ed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only n@@ ine occasion@@ s.
of their 10 vic@@ tor@@ ies, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-@@ 0@@ .
predic@@ tab@@ ly, a do@@ z@@ en of their s@@ par@@ se total of 34 came from set piec@@ es.
little won@@ der dis@@ gr@@ un@@ t@@ led re@@ actions were common at The Haw@@ thor@@ n@@ s, perhaps most no@@ tab@@ ly after a di@@ ab@@ ol@@ ical 0-@@ 0 draw with Villa in late Jan@@ u@@ ary, when the visitors looked the more lik@@ el@@ y.
on the f@@ li@@ p side, only the top six had better def@@ ensive records - though no other club could claim to regul@@ arly line up with four cent@@ re-@@ hal@@ ves.
those def@@ end@@ ers are often under@@ appreci@@ ated, not least J@@ on@@ ny Ev@@ ans, who is said to have Ar@@ sen@@ al ch@@ as@@ ing him following their latest injury cris@@ is.
the Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Champ@@ ion@@ ship and it would take a he@@ f@@ ty fee for Al@@ bi@@ on to sel@@ l.
Ben F@@ os@@ ter is depend@@ able in goal and they are well stoc@@ ked in mid@@ field.
Dar@@ ren F@@ let@@ ch@@ er, much like Ev@@ ans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 3@@ 2, and Cla@@ udi@@ o Y@@ ac@@ o@@ b is under@@ r@@ ated.
ir@@ rit@@ at@@ ingly for all parties the long and w@@ inding tal@@ e of s@@ ai@@ Do Ber@@ ah@@ ino@@ 's future remains un@@ resol@@ ved.
b@@ ids from Sto@@ ke and Cry@@ stal Palace were rejec@@ ted under Pe@@ ac@@ e's own@@ ership but the former remain ke@@ en and Mark Hu@@ gh@@ es is happy to be pati@@ ent.
after last season was close to a wri@@ te-@@ off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through@@ .
the stri@@ ker is und@@ ou@@ b@@ ted@@ ly tal@@ ented but with, as Pul@@ is mentioned more than on@@ ce, people dr@@ agg@@ ing him one way and pul@@ ling him the other it has long been evid@@ ent the relationship is un@@ work@@ able.
Al@@ bi@@ on are ins@@ istent upon sig@@ ning a replacement before let@@ ting the former England Under@@ -@@ 21 international go but their £@@ 15@@ m move for Di@@ af@@ ra S@@ ak@@ ho broke down days before the ta@@ ke@@ over, with the club st@@ ating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the seas@@ on.
it places a lot of pressure on the Venez@@ u@@ el@@ an Sal@@ om@@ ó@@ n R@@ ond@@ ó@@ n, who showed bri@@ ef fl@@ ash@@ es of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of n@@ ine go@@ als, especially if Ric@@ ki@@ e Lam@@ bert continues to be as in@@ effec@@ tive.
the decision to release Vic@@ tor An@@ ic@@ he@@ be and St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane S@@ ess@@ è@@ gn@@ on also looks od@@ d in re@@ tro@@ spec@@ t.
Pul@@ is has been no@@ tor@@ i@@ ously s@@ low to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teen@@ ag@@ ers - J@@ on@@ ath@@ an Le@@ k@@ o, S@@ am Fi@@ eld and Ty@@ ler Rob@@ er@@ ts - in the final game of last seas@@ on, a 1-@@ 1 draw with Liver@@ pool, is unlikely to become the nor@@ m.
he will return to the tried and tested but Le@@ ko is worth keeping an eye on.
the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old att@@ acking mid@@ fiel@@ der made five appear@@ ances in total last seas@@ on, becoming the first player born in 199@@ 9 to appear in the Premier Le@@ agu@@ e, and is also highly rated in the England under@@ age system.
Mat@@ t Phil@@ li@@ ps, a £@@ 5.@@ 5@@ m sig@@ ning from Que@@ ens Park R@@ ang@@ ers, will provide p@@ ace but he is the sole new player entering the opening week@@ end of the campaign@@ .
it is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a h@@ ec@@ tic one.
"@@ all over@@ ," Pul@@ is told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be streng@@ then@@ ed.
every position that you look at.
the back play@@ ers, mid@@ field players and front play@@ ers, we have to streng@@ th@@ en.
the tar@@ gets have been there, we know what we wan@@ t.
getting them is pro@@ ving more difficult than en@@ vis@@ ag@@ ed, mostly due to un@@ certain@@ ty during the ta@@ ke@@ over process.
the season could be defined by how they star@@ t, with seven em@@ in@@ ently win@@ n@@ able games before a da@@ un@@ ting run of To@@ t@@ ten@@ ham, Liver@@ pool, Manch@@ ester City and Le@@ ic@@ ester from mid@@ -@@ Octo@@ ber.
by that point the pressure on Pul@@ is will have eas@@ ed or become insur@@ moun@@ table.
and, who know@@ s, may@@ be even Ber@@ ah@@ ino will have found a new club@@ .
T@@ ata Steel UK res@@ c@@ ue deal closer after tr@@ us@@ te@@ es back pen@@ sion changes
the pen@@ sion tr@@ us@@ te@@ es behind T@@ ata Steel UK have said the sch@@ eme can be re@@ struc@@ tured without entering the Pen@@ sion Protection Fund (@@ PP@@ F@@ ), boo@@ sting the pro@@ spec@@ ts of a res@@ c@@ ue deal for the company.
the British Steel Pen@@ sion Sch@@ eme has li@@ abilities of £@@ 15@@ b@@ n and a de@@ fic@@ it of as much as £@@ 7@@ 00@@ m by some measure@@ s, making it a serious ob@@ st@@ acle for a res@@ c@@ ue deal for T@@ ata Steel UK and the Port Tal@@ bo@@ t ste@@ el@@ works in Wal@@ es.
T@@ ata Steel is increasingly confid@@ ent about sec@@ uring the future of its UK business, which emplo@@ ys 11@@ ,000 people, after tal@@ ks with the business sec@@ ret@@ ary and the Pen@@ sions Regul@@ ator.
the company plans to mer@@ ge its European oper@@ ations, including the UK business, with those of Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p, the German con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate.
however, the deal is condition@@ al on the British Steel Pen@@ sion Sch@@ eme being re@@ struc@@ tured and the government providing financial sup@@ port.
All@@ an John@@ st@@ on, chair of the pen@@ sion tr@@ us@@ te@@ es, said the sch@@ eme could avoid fall@@ ing into the PP@@ F if the benefits for workers were modi@@ fi@@ ed.
although it is well-@@ fun@@ ded compared with other sch@@ em@@ es, with the de@@ fic@@ it nar@@ row@@ ing to £@@ 300@@ m on some measure@@ s, T@@ ata Steel and Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p are ke@@ en to keep its li@@ abilities under control.
John@@ ston said the tr@@ us@@ te@@ es accepted it "@@ would not be real@@ istic@@ " for the joint venture or any bu@@ yer of T@@ ata Steel UK to take on responsibility for fun@@ ding the current and future de@@ fic@@ it.
modi@@ fying the benefits of the sch@@ eme was a more attractive option than it entering the PP@@ F, he add@@ ed, where workers would have to accept reduced ter@@ ms.
T@@ ata Steel sources have war@@ ned it could still sell Port Tal@@ bo@@ t.
the company has consisten@@ tly ref@@ used to guarantee the future of the ste@@ el@@ works since tal@@ ks began about the future of its UK business in Mar@@ ch, and this has been used as a bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing chip in tal@@ ks with the British govern@@ ment.
K@@ ou@@ shi@@ k Ch@@ atter@@ je@@ e, executive director of T@@ ata Steel Europe, said the Indian con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate wants to make its steel business "@@ more sustain@@ able@@ ."
speaking at the sid@@ elines of T@@ ata Ste@@ el@@ 's annual meeting in Indi@@ a, Ch@@ atter@@ j@@ ee said tal@@ ks to re@@ structure the pen@@ sion sch@@ eme were progres@@ s@@ ing, but he ins@@ isted the sch@@ eme is well-@@ fun@@ d@@ ed.
"@@ we are discus@@ sing with various st@@ ake@@ holder@@ s, including the British government and other st@@ ake@@ holders like the government of Wal@@ es and so on@@ ," Ch@@ atter@@ j@@ ee said, according to the Times of Indi@@ a.
there is a recognition that pen@@ sion has a certain impact in a commod@@ ity business like ste@@ el, so we have to find a struc@@ tural solu@@ tion, which does not impact the business going for@@ w@@ ard.
the pen@@ sion tr@@ us@@ te@@ es "@@ will@@ ing@@ ness to co@@ operate in tal@@ ks to re@@ structure the sch@@ eme will be wel@@ com@@ ed by T@@ ata Ste@@ el.
the potential changes to the sch@@ eme include shif@@ ting how the annual infl@@ ation@@ -based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index@@ , as well as limit@@ ing future increases in pen@@ sion payments to the minimum required by law.
John@@ ston add@@ ed: "the tr@@ us@@ tee and its advis@@ ers have provided T@@ ata Ste@@ el, the government and the Pen@@ sions Regul@@ ator with comp@@ elling evidence of the sch@@ em@@ e's ability to pay modified benefits in@@ definitely and on a low-@@ risk basis outside the Pen@@ sion Protection Fun@@ d.
our investment strategy has meant that the sch@@ em@@ e's fun@@ ding position has not been affected by recent f@@ alls in g@@ il@@ t yi@@ el@@ ds in the same way as many other UK pen@@ sion sch@@ em@@ es, and we remain confid@@ ent of the sch@@ em@@ e's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-@@ sufficient bas@@ is.

Li Def@@ an said Per@@ se@@ us is a well-@@ known cons@@ tel@@ lation in aut@@ um@@ n@@ 's star@@ ry sky and will arise in the nor@@ theast in the evening of August 12, with me@@ te@@ ors seem@@ ingly radi@@ ating from the Per@@ se@@ us to different direc@@ tions.
Beijing will encoun@@ ter show@@ ers or th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms today (@@ August 12@@ ), but the weather will remain ho@@ t. citizens should take proper prec@@ au@@ tions before going out.
the highest temperature will hit 31 ℃ in Beijing during the day today. there will be show@@ ers or th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms, but the sul@@ try weather will continu@@ e.
weather experts re@@ min@@ ded that citizens should not take a lot of sports during sul@@ try we@@ a@@ ther, and should drink more water to prevent he@@ at@@ stro@@ ke.
the dra@@ in@@ age system of the For@@ b@@ id@@ den City has been precis@@ ely measure@@ d, designed and construc@@ ted when it was buil@@ t.
the elev@@ ation of the G@@ ate of Div@@ ine Pro@@ w@@ ess to the north and the M@@ eri@@ di@@ an G@@ ate to the south stands at 4@@ 6.@@ 0@@ 5 meters and 4@@ 4.@@ 28 met@@ ers, respec@@ tivel@@ y, gener@@ ating a difference of about two meters in ground he@@ igh@@ t. this s@@ lo@@ pe has created advantages for natural dra@@ in@@ age so that the pon@@ ding could dra@@ in slow@@ ly.
the For@@ b@@ id@@ den C@@ ity's dra@@ in@@ age system is very hu@@ g@@ e. the reserv@@ ed ancient rain g@@ ut@@ ter measures more than 15 kilomet@@ ers in leng@@ th, while the sub@@ dra@@ in is as long as nearly 13 kilomet@@ ers.
all dra@@ ining can@@ als inside the For@@ b@@ id@@ den City lead to the In@@ ner Golden Water Ri@@ ver, which connec@@ ts with a 5@@ 2-@@ met@@ er-@@ wide mo@@ at outside the For@@ b@@ id@@ den City, and is linked to the O@@ uter Golden Water River and other water systems in Zhong@@ n@@ an@@ ha@@ i.
staff of the For@@ b@@ id@@ den City have re@@ placed the dam@@ aged components in time in the over@@ ha@@ ul@@ s and chec@@ ks in a bi@@ d to guarantee a smooth dra@@ in@@ age in ra@@ in@@ y days.
the role of the two major found@@ ations, which served as a message transmission pip@@ eline across the S@@ tra@@ its and between Taiwan and countries like the U.S. and Japan in the p@@ ast, is believed to be more important before Chair@@ person and senior execu@@ tives of the S@@ tra@@ its Exchange Foundation were n@@ ail@@ ed down.
Chi@@ u Ch@@ u@@ i-@@ ch@@ eng made the re@@ mark when answ@@ ering questions raised by re@@ por@@ ters in the regular press conference of the Main@@ land Affairs Council y@@ ester@@ day afterno@@ on.
y@@ et, currently the top priority of Taiwan authorities is to carry out "@@ sound official communication and inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ s," in a push to maintain the existing mechanism across the S@@ tra@@ its.
Chi@@ u Ch@@ u@@ i-@@ ch@@ eng added that public power issu@@ es, in particul@@ ar, still need to be addres@@ sed through the di@@ alogue and negoti@@ ation mechanism between public power and the authority for the best interest of Taiwan and the public.
in addition, as for co-@@ launch of the Shanghai@@ -@@ Tai@@ pe@@ i City For@@ um, Chi@@ u said urban communications and ben@@ ign inter@@ actions across the S@@ tra@@ its could help enhance understand@@ ing, and boo@@ st development of urban econom@@ y, educ@@ ation, culture and tour@@ ism.
the Main@@ land Affairs Council will keep a close eye on development of the communic@@ ation, strengthen contac@@ ts with local governments and provide necessary assist@@ ance.
the re@@ por@@ ter learned from China Railway that the bridge of the Beij@@ ing-@@ Shen@@ yang high speed r@@ ailway across the Chang@@ ch@@ un@@ -@@ Shenzhen Ex@@ pres@@ s@@ way had a successful clo@@ sure on August 12@@ .
all construction units and the vast r@@ ailway build@@ ers have carried out construction in a scientific and innovative manner since the project was commen@@ c@@ ed in July 2014, ensuring the project to proc@@ eed saf@@ ely and smoo@@ th@@ ly.
clo@@ sure of the bridge has laid a solid foundation for construction of the Beij@@ ing-@@ Shen@@ yang high speed r@@ ailway to progress smoo@@ th@@ ly.

"@@ even though there is a more than four@@ -@@ me@@ ter drop between the river and the bridg@@ e, water will flow over the bridge in the case of flash f@@ loo@@ d@@ s."
J@@ in M@@ ing@@ sh@@ eng@@ , Dep@@ uty Town Chief of Lu@@ o@@ er@@ ling Town@@ , Hu@@ o@@ shan Coun@@ ty, made the re@@ mark while g@@ est@@ uring by the Xi@@ ang@@ shu@@ i River on August 10@@ .
"@@ in the f@@ lood more than one month ago, the dam on one side of the river coll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed, with mas@@ sive st@@ ones and wash@@ ings roll@@ ing into the ri@@ ver.

"@@ workers are m@@ ould@@ ing, and the project can be bas@@ ically completed in another month@@ ," said J@@ in M@@ ing@@ sh@@ eng@@ .
"@@ take this f@@ lood pre@@ vention bank for example, the dam may coll@@ ap@@ se at any moment when f@@ lood h@@ its, and the f@@ lood would r@@ ush into houses of resid@@ ents living along the ban@@ k. now we use c@@ ement to inf@@ ill a solid dam so that we could transfer resid@@ ents along the bank with ease in the case of f@@ loo@@ ding in a bi@@ d to reduce property loss@@ es."
one of my hobb@@ ies is to bu@@ y, appreciate and collect book@@ s, and the collection of the initial issues of magaz@@ ines is a growing special category in my study room.
com@@ r@@ ade D@@ eng Xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing made the South In@@ spec@@ tion Spe@@ ech in the spring of 199@@ 2, push@@ ing the new round of reform and open@@ ing-@@ up to carry out in full sw@@ ing in the country, and the cover of this magaz@@ ine has well refl@@ ected the historical background of the year.
in the upper part of the cover@@ , Com@@ r@@ ade D@@ eng Xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing is seen le@@ aning forward to make strategic planning for the reform and open@@ ing-@@ up campaign@@ , high@@ lighting his determin@@ ation and la@@ st-@@ d@@ itch dem@@ e@@ an@@ or as a great man.
bene@@ ath the cover@@ , it is the Shenzhen Special Economic Z@@ one, which was under construction against the rising sun@@ , and citizens are seen h@@ ust@@ ling for their work.
what I collect is the initial issues of magaz@@ ines published during the countr@@ y's two times of public@@ ation res@@ ump@@ tion after its found@@ ing. they reflect that Chinese workers are always in the fore@@ front of the times, contribu@@ te to social development and lead progress of the times.
data showed that currently Sh@@ enn@@ ong@@ j@@ ia recei@@ ves around 7@@ 00@@ ,000 visitors each year, while professional statis@@ tical analysis found that it is in@@ advis@@ able for Sh@@ enn@@ ong@@ j@@ ia to receive more than 800@@ ,000 visitors each year, which may damage resources and environment of the scen@@ ic spo@@ t.
it is predic@@ ted that the number of visitors from home and abroad to Sh@@ enn@@ ong@@ j@@ ia will sur@@ ge after it is in@@ scri@@ bed to the World Heritage List@@ , while Sh@@ enn@@ ong@@ j@@ ia made an early war@@ ning against the visitor number rather than bl@@ ind@@ ly pursu@@ ing growth in the tourist number and in@@ come, which is la@@ ud@@ able.
the pro@@ ver@@ b that "@@ Mountain foot and top always see different seas@@ ons - mid@@ summer against spring or aut@@ um@@ n against w@@ inter@@ , with the four seas@@ ons being difficult to dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ " has high@@ ligh@@ ted the unique and typical cli@@ m@@ atic features of Sh@@ enn@@ ong@@ ji@@ a.
There@@ out, Sh@@ enn@@ ong@@ ji@@ a's practice of promoting sustainable tour@@ ism to protect ec@@ ological environment rather than pursu@@ ing over@@ explo@@ itation is worth learning and refer@@ ring to by other World Heritage scen@@ ic spo@@ ts.
ob@@ vi@@ ously, if the application for World Heritage is viewed from the economic perspec@@ tive, a her@@ itage will be taken as a "@@ gol@@ den bow@@ l@@ ," while its future will look gri@@ m no matter how good it is now.
there are many past experiences to learn from at home and ab@@ road@@ ; for instance, six World Heritage sites in China received y@@ ellow card war@@ ning at the S@@ ession of the World Heritage Committee held in 2010 mainly due to the change of ec@@ ological environment after over@@ explo@@ it@@ ation.
T@@ ang Ji@@ agu@@ i, dep@@ uty chief of the animal management department at Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing Z@@ oo@@ , told the re@@ por@@ ter that if a female p@@ anda gives birth to tw@@ ins in the wil@@ d, it would usually choose to feed the strong@@ er one but ne@@ gl@@ ect or turn down the weak@@ er one.
now the baby p@@ and@@ as need to be fed every six hour@@ s, while they have to be separated when being f@@ ed, or el@@ se, their m@@ um "@@ L@@ an Xi@@ ang@@ " will re@@ act def@@ ensi@@ vel@@ y.
Ram@@ os, a former Philipp@@ ine president and a special en@@ vo@@ y to China, wr@@ apped up his visit to Hong Kong and returned to the Philippines by Philipp@@ ine Air@@ lines at around 1: 00@@ pm today (@@ August 12@@ ).
Ram@@ os made a statement before leaving Hong Kong, saying that he had a friendly and happy meeting with his old friends in Hong Kong, and they discus@@ sed how to advance peace and cooperation between the two countries as individu@@ als.
he also e@@ up@@ hem@@ ized that even though it was not an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ aking vis@@ it, it could bring a tur@@ n@@ around to the Sin@@ o-@@ Philippines rel@@ ations.
Ram@@ os indicated in the statement that F@@ u Y@@ ing and W@@ u Sh@@ ic@@ un attended the meeting as individuals to have inform@@ al discus@@ sion@@ s.
China has expressed its welcome to Ram@@ o@@ s' will of paying a visit to Beijing as a special en@@ vo@@ y to China.
Ram@@ os said that the Government of Philippines is w@@ illing to have a form@@ al talk with the Chinese Government on issues of common concern at the right time.
Ram@@ os also emphas@@ ized at the sum@@ -up press conference that no concrete issues about disputes arising from the South China Sea were discus@@ sed during the meet@@ ing.
Ram@@ o@@ s: we didn't cover the concrete issues about the South China Se@@ a, except for the fair fishing rights, which we also mentioned in the state@@ ment.
Ram@@ os also jo@@ ked that even though it was not an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ aking visit to Hong Kong, it could bring a tur@@ n@@ around to the Sin@@ o-@@ Philippines rel@@ ations.
Ram@@ o@@ s: former Inter@@ ior and Local Government Secretary Al@@ un@@ an said that this visit to Hong Kong was origin@@ ally for the purpose of ice break@@ ing, but it seemed that there was no ice to break in the summer in Hong K@@ ong.
as for time of the next meet@@ ing, Ram@@ os said it will be decided by the President Du@@ ter@@ te as well as development of the situ@@ ation. it will be held in September at the so@@ on@@ est, but the can@@ di@@ dates have not been n@@ ail@@ ed down y@@ et.
according to the announc@@ ement, N@@ ig@@ er's capital Ni@@ am@@ ey and the T@@ ill@@ ab@@ er@@ i region were sever@@ ely affected by the f@@ loo@@ d, with ra@@ in@@ stor@@ m ca@@ using damages to mas@@ sive infrastructure facilities including farm@@ land, ro@@ ads and bridg@@ es.
continuous ra@@ inf@@ all and severe th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms have domin@@ ated Y@@ un@@ nan in the first ten days of Aug@@ ust@@ .
the main urban area of K@@ un@@ ming saw several times of sing@@ le-@@ point heavy ra@@ inf@@ all in early Aug@@ ust, and the average ra@@ inf@@ all stood at 8@@ 2@@ mm in the city, 48@@ % higher than the same period in the past@@ .
y@@ et, throughout the year, the average ra@@ inf@@ all of K@@ un@@ ming by early August was still slightly smaller than that of the previous years.
the ra@@ inf@@ all sustain@@ ed across much of Y@@ un@@ n@@ an, while some regions had th@@ under@@ stor@@ m, shor@@ t-@@ time strong ra@@ inf@@ all, ha@@ il, g@@ ale and other severe conv@@ ec@@ tive we@@ ather@@ .
ra@@ inf@@ all in the main urban area of K@@ un@@ ming dec@@ reas@@ ed compared to the day before y@@ ester@@ day, and was not strong@@ . the weather got war@@ mer@@ .
according to forec@@ asts of the prov@@ in@@ cial me@@ te@@ or@@ ological observ@@ atory, the show@@ ery weather will su@@ st@@ ain in K@@ un@@ ming in the coming three days, while the temperature will bas@@ ically remain un@@ changed at between 17 ℃ and 26 ℃@@ .
the municip@@ al government approved it rec@@ ently, requ@@ iring all related di@@ stric@@ ts and coun@@ ties as well as units to implement it to fully guarantee the life and property security of people along the ri@@ ver.
the "@@ Chinese style of crossing road@@ s" can be seen every@@ where for a long time, and people have become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the phenomen@@ on that ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans j@@ ay@@ walk and cli@@ m@@ b over rail@@ ings rec@@ k@@ less@@ ly.
the traffic police department will start cap@@ tur@@ ing such traffic ir@@ regul@@ ari@@ ties with the help of e-@@ police from next Mon@@ day (@@ August 15@@ ).
the e-@@ police will take a total of three pictures of the ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an who tou@@ ches the virtual induc@@ tion co@@ il, and the information will be entered into the "@@ Road traffic off@@ ense system@@ " after being re@@ viewed and veri@@ fied by man to pen@@ al@@ ize the two abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned ir@@ regul@@ ari@@ ties.

the U.S. plans to test the TH@@ A@@ AD system in 2017 over claim to inter@@ c@@ ept D@@ PR@@ K@@ 's mis@@ sil@@ es
IT@@ AR@@ -T@@ AS@@ S quo@@ ted James Sy@@ ring as saying that they had tested the Air Def@@ ense Advanced Mobile System (@@ AD@@ AM@@ S) of the U.S. for inter@@ c@@ ep@@ ting short@@ - and medi@@ um-@@ range mis@@ sil@@ es in a few years.
"the system has passed all these test@@ s, and now we plan to test the long-@@ distance effect of these weap@@ on@@ s."
we requested the U.S. and South Korea to immediately stop deplo@@ ying the TH@@ A@@ AD an@@ tim@@ is@@ s@@ ile system, never take actions to lead to com@@ plic@@ ated regional situation and never do things det@@ ri@@ mental to China's strategic security interest@@ s.
windows of three neigh@@ b@@ ors were bro@@ k@@ en, and two gre@@ at-@@ grand@@ mo@@ thers who came to dis@@ su@@ ade him were pushed to the ground.
recently this fur@@ ious man was brought under control by police of the N@@ anch@@ eng police station in An@@ l@@ u City in a timely man@@ ner.
after receiving re@@ port, police of the N@@ anch@@ eng police station in An@@ l@@ u City took dec@@ isi@@ ve measures to sub@@ due Xi@@ ao M@@ ing to prevent him from hur@@ ting the in@@ no@@ cent@@ .
police investig@@ ations showed that Xi@@ ao M@@ ing@@ 's parents have all been aged above 60@@ , and the family r@@ are@@ ly deal@@ t with others, and thus the possibility of being induc@@ ed by others to go wh@@ oring could be elimin@@ ated.
the police found through investig@@ ations that Xi@@ ao M@@ ing was over@@ ly el@@ ated, and what he said and did was different from ordinary people. they learned after in@@ qu@@ iring his family members that Xi@@ ao M@@ ing has become in@@ door@@ sy since one year ago, ref@@ using to contact or communicate with others.
police susp@@ ected that Xi@@ ao M@@ ing@@ 's ab@@ normal behavi@@ ors were due to mental dist@@ urb@@ ance caused by his long-term staying at home. An@@ l@@ u mental health center diagno@@ sed that Xi@@ ao M@@ ing had developed mental diseas@@ e.
currently Xi@@ ao M@@ ing has been sent by the related depart@@ ments to the mental health center to receive free treat@@ ment.
on August 11, W@@ ir@@ t@@ sch@@ af@@ ts@@ W@@ o@@ che quo@@ ted We@@ ise, head of the B@@ AM@@ F, as saying that only 24@@ 0@@ ,000 refu@@ ge@@ es have entered Germany year to date, far smaller than expect@@ ation.
despite the drop in the number of refu@@ ge@@ es f@@ loo@@ ding into Germany, the B@@ AM@@ F still has an ard@@ u@@ ous tas@@ k. currently there are still around 500@@ ,000 as@@ yl@@ um applications left un@@ process@@ ed.
even so, an increasing number of refu@@ ge@@ es have filed law@@ su@@ its against the B@@ AM@@ F, and some of the as@@ yl@@ um applic@@ ants have wai@@ ted for more than two years.
by the end of 2015, nearly 2,@@ 300 cases against "@@ non@@ fe@@ as@@ anc@@ e" of the B@@ AM@@ F had been fil@@ ed.
Bank of Russia said that the growth was mainly attribu@@ table to re@@ assess@@ ment of the market expect@@ ation on the countr@@ y's econom@@ y.
the international reserves of Russia have been on the decline in recent years am@@ id the down@@ ward economic pressure fac@@ ed by the country due to the Western sanc@@ tions against Russi@@ a, coupl@@ ing with the dro@@ pping international oil pric@@ es.
Holly@@ wood bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers, which are well mad@@ e, star@@ -@@ stud@@ ded and h@@ yp@@ ed, have been feat@@ ured in the film market in recent years. it seemed that all people are discus@@ sing them, and go to cin@@ em@@ a to watch them together.
then is it truly as we thought that bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers always rock the cin@@ em@@ a and make a b@@ und@@ le of mon@@ ey@@ ?
und@@ ou@@ b@@ ted@@ ly, the production costs of Holly@@ wood bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers have been sur@@ g@@ ing year by year, and the growth is even far beyond that of the infl@@ ation r@@ ate.
data from Ch@@ art 1 showed that the number of Holly@@ wood fil@@ ms, which were produced during the dec@@ ade from 199@@ 5 to 2004 and cost over US $@@ 100 milli@@ on, to@@ tal@@ ed 60@@ .
while the figure sur@@ g@@ ed to 19@@ 7 during the 11 years from 200@@ 5 to 201@@ 5.
the shar@@ p increase in film production number indic@@ ates a rising production cost on a@@ ver@@ age, which has ar@@ ous@@ ed al@@ ert of the industry.
famous direc@@ tors Sp@@ i@@ el@@ berg and Luc@@ as once critic@@ ized such phenomen@@ on in a for@@ um activ@@ ity, saying that if this continu@@ es, the industry would "@@ imp@@ lo@@ de@@ ."
among these 29 fil@@ ms, the highest proportion of marketing costs to total costs stood at 40@@ %, while the lowest even reached as high as 24@@ %.
the average costs of physical cop@@ y, production of audio and video products and transport reached US $@@ 6@@ 7.@@ 8 million for each fil@@ m.
in 200@@ 5, Dre@@ am@@ Works made 5 million DVD cop@@ ies of Sh@@ re@@ k 2 but found a poor sales market, which made the company fail to realize its income target of the quarter as a resul@@ t.
an average amount of US $@@ 36@@ .@@ 6 million needed to be taken out from these 29 fil@@ ms for re@@ venue sharing and compens@@ ation among directors, produc@@ ers, scrip@@ tw@@ rit@@ ers, pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ists as well as other cast and cre@@ w@@ .
for Holly@@ wood studi@@ os, the re@@ venue sharing mechanism could help them reduce financial pressure in the early st@@ age, while it turns out to be an inc@@ enti@@ ve for the cast and cre@@ w@@ .
among these 29 fil@@ ms, prof@@ itable ones shared 9@@ % of income on average and one even shared as much as 18@@ %, while fil@@ ms that suffer@@ ed losses also shared around 5% of income on a@@ ver@@ age.
it is no@@ te@@ wor@@ thy that the cast and cre@@ w would ask for share the "@@ re@@ venu@@ e" rather than the "@@ prof@@ it."
under operation of the tr@@ ick@@ y accoun@@ ting system of Holly@@ woo@@ d, some fil@@ ms that could have made a b@@ und@@ le may event@@ ually turn out to be in the red.
for instance, a report reve@@ aled about Har@@ ry Pot@@ ter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2010 indicated that War@@ ner still claim@@ ed two years after distribution of the film that it lost US $@@ 16@@ 7 million in the fil@@ m, making profit sharing an emp@@ ty tal@@ k.
Holly@@ wood also needs to pay a certain amount of bon@@ us to the union formed by various working staff@@ , while these 29 fil@@ ms paid an average of US $@@ 11.@@ 7@@ 6 million for that.
in addition, the operating costs of Holly@@ wood Pic@@ tures would also be shared by fil@@ ms, while these 29 fil@@ ms shared an average of US $@@ 14.@@ 8@@ 3 milli@@ on.
after d@@ educ@@ ting the sales tax and g@@ ains shared by cin@@ em@@ as, the film company could receive 53@@ % box office sales of the North America and 4@@ 1@@ % of the world, amoun@@ ting to around US $@@ 16@@ 9 milli@@ on.
after an average marketing exp@@ ense of US $@@ 9@@ 8 million for distribution was d@@ educ@@ ted, there was only around US $@@ 70 million left.
these 29 fil@@ ms each generated an average income of US $@@ 13@@ 4.@@ 3 million from distribution of home audio and video products.
after d@@ educ@@ ting the average marketing exp@@ ense of US $@@ 21.@@ 9 million and production cost of US $3@@ 0.5 milli@@ on, the net income stood at US $@@ 8@@ 1.@@ 9 million on a@@ ver@@ age, which top@@ ped the income li@@ st. its profit rate was much higher than that of the@@ at@@ r@@ ical distribu@@ tion.
paid TV channels created US $@@ 14.@@ 6 million of income on average for these fil@@ ms, a little bit more than the US $@@ 13@@ .@@ 3 million created by fre@@ e-@@ to-@@ air chann@@ els.
among these 29 fil@@ ms, about half generated less than 1@@ % of income from video on demand (@@ V@@ OD@@ ), and even fil@@ ms released after 2011 only generated 4.@@ 1@@ % of income from this business.
Holly@@ wood still took a relatively conserv@@ ative attit@@ ude toward V@@ O@@ D when building the distribution system of these bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers.
as for derivative development, these 29 fil@@ ms generated an average income of US $@@ 1@@ 1.5 million by author@@ izing derivative development.
y@@ et, almost two thir@@ ds of the derivative development income came from the top two sup@@ er bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers, and only one third of them ear@@ ned more than US $@@ 1 million from this.
apart from the sources of income mentioned above, these Holly@@ wood bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers still had b@@ its of income from air@@ craft broad@@ cast and music, which a@@ ver@@ aged at US $@@ 2.@@ 7 million at most for each fil@@ m.
surpris@@ ingly, Ste@@ phen@@ 's statistics showed that these 29 Holly@@ wood bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ers generated US $@@ 14.@@ 8 million of prof@@ its on a@@ ver@@ age, while the profit rate only reached 3.@@ 7@@ %.
if the long re@@ venue recovery process is taken into account, this profit rate could hard@@ ly beat the infl@@ ation.
fil@@ ms with costs in the lowest range between US $@@ 100 million and US $@@ 12@@ 5 million delivered the wor@@ st performance in prof@@ it@@ ability, and only one third of them ear@@ ned money.
however, three quar@@ ters of the fil@@ ms with costs in the highest range of above US $@@ 200 million made prof@@ its.
core promp@@ t: in 2014, D@@ ur@@ ant renew@@ ed his se@@ ven@@ -@@ year US $@@ 60 million contract with Ni@@ ke by sig@@ ning a ten@@ -@@ year contract worth US $@@ 300 milli@@ on.

Japanese media said that Japan@@ 's foreign minist@@ er, F@@ um@@ io K@@ ish@@ id@@ a, left for the Philippines to pay a visit on August 11 and held tal@@ ks with Ro@@ dri@@ go Du@@ ter@@ te, president of the country, to strengthen bil@@ at@@ eral cooper@@ ation.
both Japan and the US are e@@ ag@@ er to keep close touch with the Philippines in the fields including economic cooperation with the inten@@ tion to prevent the Philippines from sw@@ inging to China.
K@@ ish@@ ida specially went to Dav@@ ao City, base of Du@@ ter@@ te, instead of Man@@ il@@ a, the cap@@ it@@ al, so as to hope to confirm cooper@@ ative relationship with the Philippines on the issue of the South China Se@@ a.
K@@ err@@ y, on the second day after particip@@ ating in a relevant conference of the AS@@ E@@ AN held in La@@ os in late J@@ ul@@ y, met with Du@@ ter@@ te in Man@@ il@@ a. both sides reached a cons@@ ensu@@ s on the issue of respec@@ ting the arbitration rul@@ ing on the South China Se@@ a.
Du@@ ter@@ te told Ker@@ ry that "the arbitration rul@@ ing will constitute the base when any negoti@@ ation is conduc@@ ted@@ ."
the US and Japan have been streng@@ th@@ ening their cooperation with the Philipp@@ in@@ es. in 2014, the US and the Philippines signed a new military agre@@ ement, wh@@ ich, in fact, again permitted the American tro@@ op@@ s to station in the Philippines 25 years later, the report said.

speaking of the wor@@ d, we realize that it not only impli@@ es too much meaning but also car@@ ries rich conten@@ ts.
many people have realized that in X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ing@@ 's series of tal@@ ks, artic@@ les, spe@@ ech@@ es and inter@@ view@@ s, famous qu@@ ot@@ ations from ancient Chinese books and records as well as class@@ ics are found every@@ wher@@ e, manif@@ est@@ ing highly cultural self-@@ confidence and ar@@ ous@@ ing the wid@@ es@@ pre@@ ad res@@ on@@ ance all over the world.
facts have proved that along with the rise of contemporary China, the influence and attrac@@ tion of the Chinese culture is increasingly being streng@@ then@@ ed.
the Chinese modern history of over 100 years has already told us that all the ro@@ ad, theory and system are ro@@ oted in the cul@@ ture.
of course, for a time, we learned from Western countries about their imple@@ ments, systems and cul@@ tures and kept re@@ thinking in this process.
after a long-term expl@@ or@@ ation, we have found that the firm confidence in China's moder@@ ni@@ z@@ ation deri@@ ves from the "@@ spiritual gen@@ e" of the Chinese n@@ ation.
in X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ing@@ 's spe@@ ech@@ es and investig@@ ations, the discussions on excellent traditional Chinese culture including Con@@ fuc@@ i@@ an@@ ism are beyond coun@@ t.
he also said that for several thousand years, the Chinese nation has taken her civil@@ ization development path different from those of other countries and n@@ ations.
we have not occasion@@ ally b@@ la@@ zed the soci@@ alist road with Chinese character@@ istic@@ s, which is determined by the historical inher@@ it@@ ance and cultural tradition of our country.
in 201@@ 0, China's GD@@ P stood second in the world. however, China '@@ achiev@@ ements are more than econom@@ y.
either excellent traditional cul@@ ture, revolu@@ tionary culture or advanced soci@@ alist culture is demonstr@@ ating un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented v@@ ital@@ ity.
in sp@@ ite of the fact that the Chinese culture is tim@@ e-@@ hon@@ ored and has v@@ ig@@ or@@ ous development moment@@ um, it cannot be d@@ eni@@ ed that its current influence and function are far from re@@ aching its due he@@ igh@@ t.
though China has experienced a lost time in the past few hundred years, yet now she has returned to the world stage in a more powerful man@@ ner.
just as Sim@@ se@@ k said, today's China is making contribu@@ tions to the world in a brand@@ -@@ new way.

at the same time, due to the lack of understanding of de@@ pres@@ sive dis@@ order and anxi@@ ety ail@@ ments, common citizens er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously think that patients are in a fit of pi@@ que instead of giving them timely understanding and emo@@ tional sup@@ port, which is also the main reason for a lower out@@ patient r@@ ate.

according to the report by Y@@ on@@ ha@@ p on August 10, this sti@@ pul@@ ation pos@@ es a challenge to many fir@@ st-@@ class Korean restaurants that were origin@@ ally going to exclusi@@ vely enter@@ tain political fig@@ ures and senior civil serv@@ ants.
many Korean restaurant bo@@ ss@@ es are wor@@ ri@@ ed about their future business because of the law, Y@@ on@@ ha@@ p re@@ por@@ ted.
in In@@ s@@ ad@@ ong of Seoul@@ , a restaurant which has been doing business since 196@@ 9 is often pat@@ ron@@ ized by political fig@@ ures, government offici@@ als, media re@@ por@@ ters and merch@@ ants.
the bo@@ ss of the restaurant told the re@@ por@@ ter from Y@@ on@@ ha@@ p that for many years they have been proud of offering luxury food and private dining environment to customers.
in the past ten years, the restaurant has offered high-@@ speci@@ fication set me@@ als. however, "@@ in order to satisfy the upper limit of table money set by The Impro@@ per Sol@@ ic@@ itation and Gra@@ ft Ac@@ t, we will have to change the tradition of several dec@@ ad@@ es, which is really a difficult decision@@ ."
"@@ char@@ co@@ al Fire Bar@@ bec@@ ue Vill@@ age@@ " mainly offers be@@ ef bar@@ bec@@ u@@ e. according to its general manag@@ er, the price of "@@ Han@@ -@@ u@@ " (@@ Korean be@@ ef@@ ), a sign@@ ature dis@@ h of the restaur@@ ant, is over 50@@ ,000 Korean w@@ on.
"@@ we predic@@ t that from October on, the sales volume will great@@ ly reduce so we are considering replac@@ ing Han@@ -@@ u in set me@@ als with im@@ ported be@@ ef@@ ."
located in J@@ ong@@ no district, Seoul@@ , the restaurant which was well-@@ known for the pat@@ ron@@ age by political V@@ IP@@ s such as former presid@@ ents Ro@@ h Ta@@ e-@@ w@@ oo and Lee My@@ ung@@ -@@ b@@ ak closed down last mon@@ th.
before long@@ , the restaurant will di@@ ver@@ t to eng@@ aging in Vietnam r@@ ice no@@ od@@ les and the per cap@@ ita dining standard is around 10, 000 Korean W@@ on (R@@ MB 60 yu@@ an@@ ).
facing the possible economic loss, South Korean President Park Ge@@ un@@ -@@ hy@@ e said at a cab@@ inet conference on the 10@@ th day that what is important is to reduce its negative effects as far as possible while stic@@ king to the core part of the Impro@@ per Sol@@ ic@@ itation and Gra@@ ft Ac@@ t.
she said, "@@ Once the law is put into forc@@ e, the social transparen@@ cy and fair@@ ness will be more or less improved and the efficiency in economy will increas@@ e, too. therefore, the economic growth of S. Korea will speed up@@ ."
while driving vehicles in our daily life, we often go through tun@@ n@@ els, sometimes even super@@ -@@ long tun@@ n@@ els or tun@@ nel grou@@ ps. so, whether tun@@ n@@ els are safe is important to us.
if traffic needs to be closed or a carri@@ ag@@ ew@@ ay is occup@@ ied for a long time due to the maintenance projec@@ t, except for emergency situ@@ ation, the management and maintenance unit shall issue to the public the information of construction and traffic control together with the traffic police department 15 days ahead of time.
when a traffic accid@@ ent takes place, it is im@@ per@@ ative to carry out traffic control immediately to keep second@@ ary accid@@ ents from happ@@ ening through measures such as pat@@ ro@@ l and pro@@ pag@@ and@@ a.
the public security organ can design@@ ate the route and the time for vehicles load@@ ed with dang@@ erous chem@@ icals to pass or pro@@ hi@@ bit such vehicles from pass@@ ing according to the requirements of the safety protection of high@@ way tun@@ n@@ els and the technical conditions of high@@ way tun@@ n@@ els and issue the notice to the public.
according to Chin@@ an@@ ew@@ s.com on August 12, Shen@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un@@ , press spo@@ k@@ es@@ man for the National B@@ ure@@ au of Statis@@ tics said today that the surve@@ yed urban un@@ employment rate in Li@@ a@@ oning is higher than the national average level. since its economy is experienc@@ ing adjust@@ ment, the interior pressure is rather big@@ .
judg@@ ing from the over@@ -@@ all situ@@ ation, since the international economy is under deep adjust@@ ment, its recovery is relatively slow@@ , which will bring about a large pressure on China's import including the import of Li@@ a@@ oning provinc@@ e.
therefore, in this new round of adjust@@ ment, it is the price of the products of heavy and chemical industries that is under@@ going the deep@@ est adjust@@ ment, thus in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably bringing down@@ ward pressure on the economy of Li@@ a@@ on@@ ing.
after entering the period of the 13@@ th Fi@@ ve-@@ Year Pl@@ an, since its original base number was high@@ , in terms of data manif@@ est@@ ation, this round of adjustment has much more been reduced than other region.
Shen@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un sum@@ mar@@ ized that the economic adjustment of Li@@ a@@ oning has its special economic reason@@ s, including not only the influence of cycl@@ ical fac@@ tors, but also that of struc@@ tural factors and even that of base effect and that generally it is in the process of adjust@@ ment.
Shen@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un also reve@@ aled that since its economy is being adj@@ us@@ ted, the fact that the urban un@@ employment rate of Li@@ a@@ oning is higher than the national average level indic@@ ates that its interior pressure is rather big@@ .
we believe that through the joint efforts of all asp@@ ec@@ ts, the economy in the nor@@ the@@ astern region including Li@@ a@@ oning will display the vit@@ ality of the former old industrial base for the second time.

on the morning of August 11, a journ@@ alist of Q@@ il@@ u E@@ ven@@ ing News found in a surve@@ y conducted among some real estate projects in the urban area that the property consult@@ ants of those projects have lear@@ nt the di@@ vision of the school di@@ stric@@ ts and introduced it to their customers.
"@@ our community belong@@ s to the school district of Y@@ ong@@ f@@ eng Street Pri@@ mary Scho@@ ol. it will be convenient for property owners to send their kids to the school@@ ."

since its development in China, crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ding has shown a positive image to the public. regions across China have started improving the environment around them through crow@@ d@@ fun@@ d@@ ing.
not long ago, the parents in a resid@@ ential quarter in N@@ an@@ '@@ an city launched a reading room for their kids through crow@@ d@@ fun@@ d@@ ing.
because they wanted the kids to keep a good reading hab@@ it during the summer vac@@ ation, dro@@ pping cell phones and compu@@ ters to return to the most original way in recre@@ ation and enter@@ tain@@ ment.
such a reading room with love not only fo@@ stered children@@ 's reading hab@@ its, but also offered them a good place to go during the summer vac@@ ation.
in addition to reading rooms, crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ding has also brought some warm@@ th to lef@@ t-@@ behind children, a gr@@ ave problem facing China now.
re@@ por@@ ted@@ ly, there are more than 3@@ ,000 lef@@ t-@@ behind children in central and western Hu@@ ang@@ y@@ an, most of whom are living with their el@@ der@@ ly grand@@ parents at home. their parents have to work in other regions to ear@@ n money. therefore, they may only see their parents once a year.
the lack of k@@ in@@ ship and correct guid@@ ance frequently become an ir@@ retriev@@ able p@@ ity for the kids during their grow@@ th.
it seems that laun@@ ching reading rooms for kid@@ s, building hom@@ es for lef@@ t-@@ behind children, as well as other mean@@ ing@@ ful things ali@@ ke can only be managed through crow@@ d@@ fun@@ d@@ ing.
"@@ as an emerging industry in Internet fin@@ ance, crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ding is grad@@ ually exten@@ ding its advantages to all asp@@ ec@@ ts. it has not only changed our living environment, but also sil@@ ently changed our ide@@ as@@ ."
H@@ an Ji@@ any@@ u, general manager of X@@ f@@ .c@@ c@@ , said that X@@ f@@ .c@@ c is engaged in the establishment of a crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ding system. a staff member of the company has also raised funds through crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ding on We@@ Chat after his family members were attack@@ ed by a diseas@@ e.
what I want to say here is that crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ding is not only an industry, but also a positive attit@@ ude and an ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dating spir@@ it.
it is bound@@ l@@ ess. if you need and are bra@@ ve enough to initi@@ ate crow@@ d@@ fun@@ d@@ ing, everything will become possible.

Colombi@@ a and Venez@@ u@@ ela also agreed to work towards the full re@@ opening of the b@@ order, saying they needed first to reach separate agre@@ ements on security, commerce and energ@@ y.

it was the Mo@@ ther@@ 's Day and the birth@@ day of the que@@ en of Thail@@ and. however, many regions of the country were in a hor@@ ri@@ fic atmosp@@ here.
a staff member of Hit@@ our, an overseas self-@@ service tour service ag@@ ency, has just paid a visit to one of the explo@@ sion sites.
the attack may have been small with a small har@@ m according to the explo@@ sion site.
disputes have been raised over the dra@@ ft of Thail@@ and@@ 's new constitu@@ tion since it was un@@ ve@@ il@@ ed, with foc@@ uses on the cl@@ a@@ uses on military pow@@ er.
sup@@ por@@ ters believed that the new constitu@@ tion can he@@ al Thail@@ and@@ 's w@@ ound and promote the st@@ abil@@ ization of the country.
op@@ pon@@ ents believed that this is an "@@ un@@ fair refer@@ end@@ um@@ ." once the constitu@@ tion is pass@@ ed, the military will gain more pow@@ er.
especi@@ ally, the new cl@@ a@@ uses introduced to the dra@@ ft will weak@@ en political parti@@ es' power but give more power to non-@@ elec@@ ted sen@@ ator@@ s.
the Gu@@ ardi@@ an said that the attacks seem@@ ingly tar@@ get@@ ing tour@@ ism attractions actually happened before the an@@ nivers@@ ary of the Bangkok bl@@ ast taking place on August 17, 201@@ 5.

"@@ we felt the treatment effect was good after taking the products. however, they were marked up to R@@ MB 3@@ ,000 one week lat@@ er. then, we didn't buy them again@@ ."
W@@ ang Xin@@ li@@ ang said that according to the cases he has encoun@@ tered in recent two years. the el@@ der@@ ly were easy to be che@@ ated. most of the fra@@ ud@@ s took place when they buy dru@@ g@@ s, health@@ care products and wealth management products.
"@@ some el@@ der@@ ly people bought a great number of health@@ care products. some who have high re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pay didn't follow their kid@@ s' advice although they knew they had been che@@ ated. some even had conflic@@ ts with their family member@@ s."
according to the report of an economic comment program of CN@@ R@@ -@@ 2, online shopping is becoming the daily consumption means of many people. how many online sho@@ pper@@ s will give a negative comment when shopping experience f@@ alls short of their expect@@ ation@@ s?
about 5@@ 6.@@ 4@@ % respon@@ d@@ ents of the surve@@ y said consu@@ mer@@ s' right to give negative comments is an objec@@ tive refl@@ ection of the public monitoring system in the virtual online soci@@ ety, while 7@@ 9.@@ 3@@ % believed that it is necessary to launch relevant measures to protect consu@@ mer@@ s' right to give negative com@@ ments.
however, merchant@@ s' pressure should never be released through illegal mean@@ s, while consumers should make good use of their righ@@ ts.
if the comments of consumers are per@@ tin@@ ent, you should accept such comments and improve your services.
if some@@ one's comments are aim@@ ed to weak@@ en your competi@@ tiveness on purpose. you can saf@@ e@@ guard your rights according to the regulations of the anti-@@ un@@ fair competition law.
if their mal@@ icious s@@ land@@ ers damage your business reputation and cred@@ its, you can lo@@ dge a civil li@@ ti@@ gation or report the case to relevant authori@@ ties.
according to relevant regulations in law, if merch@@ ants public@@ ize your information to re@@ ven@@ ge you for your com@@ ments, they are actually infring@@ ing your reputation and information security righ@@ ts. however, it will cost a lot of time and efforts for you to file a law@@ suit against them.
on the other hand, those who public@@ ize other@@ s' personal information should be held responsible through laws and regul@@ ations. al@@ so, there should be a regul@@ ation on the punish@@ ment of online s@@ land@@ ers.

Thailand B@@ om@@ b B@@ la@@ sts At Tourist Hot@@ spo@@ ts K@@ ill Four
a series of b@@ om@@ b b@@ la@@ sts across five of Thail@@ and@@ 's southern provinc@@ es targeted popular tourist destinations on Th@@ urs@@ day and Fri@@ day, leaving four people dead and many more inj@@ ure@@ d, after the country vo@@ ted to appro@@ ve a mil@@ it@@ ar@@ y-@@ back@@ ed constitu@@ tion.
two explo@@ sions first hit the seas@@ ide resort of Hu@@ a H@@ in on Th@@ urs@@ day night, before another bl@@ ast struc@@ k on Fri@@ day mor@@ ning.
the town is located some 200 kilomet@@ ers south of Bangko@@ k.
the first bl@@ ast killed one Thai woman and inj@@ ured 20 people, 10 of them fore@@ ign@@ ers, police said.
authorities confirm@@ ed that other b@@ la@@ sts had targeted the southern cities of Phu@@ ket@@ , Tr@@ ang and Sur@@ at Th@@ ani@@ .
two b@@ om@@ bs explo@@ ded in the town of Pat@@ ong in Phuket and two more in Ph@@ ang N@@ g@@ a, another tourist region just north of Phu@@ ket@@ .
a total of 11 b@@ om@@ b b@@ la@@ sts struc@@ k the country over the last 24 hour@@ s.
the b@@ la@@ sts were not linked to Islam@@ ic extre@@ mis@@ m but acts of local s@@ abo@@ t@@ age, Royal Thai Pol@@ ice official Col@@ . K@@ ris@@ ana Pat@@ an@@ ach@@ ar@@ o@@ en said on Fri@@ day.
"@@ it's too soon to j@@ ump to any concl@@ us@@ ion@@ ," he said.
but what we know for sure is that the incid@@ ents are not linked directly to any kinds of terror@@ ism, in fact it's local s@@ abo@@ tage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scen@@ es.
investig@@ ation offici@@ als collect evidence from the cri@@ me scen@@ e after a small b@@ om@@ b explo@@ ded in Hu@@ a H@@ in on August 12, 201@@ 6.
a string of b@@ om@@ b attacks tar@@ get@@ ing Thail@@ and@@ 's cruc@@ ial tour@@ ism industry have killed four people, offici@@ als said on August 12, sending authorities sc@@ ram@@ bling to identify a mo@@ tive and find the perpet@@ r@@ ator@@ s.
there are no conflic@@ ts in the country that may lead to terror@@ ists being in the country.
"@@ that's why we can say that these incid@@ ents are not terror@@ ist attack@@ s," he continu@@ ed.
no group has yet claim@@ ed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not acc@@ used any particular grou@@ p, but the explo@@ sions occur@@ red in the same week that Thai vo@@ ters approved a new constitu@@ tion.
the three southern provinc@@ es of Hu@@ a H@@ in, Phuket and Ph@@ ang N@@ ga all rejec@@ ted the mil@@ it@@ ar@@ y-@@ back@@ ed refer@@ end@@ um, and the Mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority sou@@ the@@ astern provinc@@ es of Thailand have fac@@ ed an insur@@ g@@ ency that has left more than 6@@ ,@@ 500 people dead since 200@@ 4.
the b@@ la@@ sts came on the birth@@ day of Thail@@ and@@ 's Queen Si@@ ri@@ k@@ it, a public holiday in the country.
king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ ay@@ ade@@ j is the world's long@@ est-@@ serving mon@@ ar@@ ch.
it's difficult to jud@@ ge the truth of these claim@@ s.
Ukra@@ ine den@@ ies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evid@@ ence.
an open@@ -@@ source analysis grou@@ p, the Digital Fo@@ ren@@ si@@ c Research Lab@@ , found some indic@@ ations of a fire@@ fight on Satur@@ day, but little to back up Mo@@ sc@@ ow@@ 's grand@@ er claim@@ s.
Russia has been known to di@@ stor@@ t or mis@@ state events to serve political end@@ s, particularly within the fo@@ g of Ukra@@ ine@@ 's sti@@ ll@@ -@@ on@@ going conflic@@ t.
that doesn't mean that Russi@@ a's claims are all fal@@ se.
Ukra@@ inian mil@@ iti@@ as last year s@@ abo@@ t@@ aged electricity p@@ yl@@ ons that power Cri@@ me@@ a, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights viol@@ ations.
an attemp@@ ted attack in Cri@@ me@@ a is not out of the ques@@ tion, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukra@@ inian government would spon@@ sor such a p@@ lo@@ t.
whatever happen@@ ed, images found by open@@ -@@ source analy@@ sts suggest that Russia has been es@@ cal@@ ating its military presence in Cri@@ me@@ a since at least Satur@@ day - before the sup@@ posed attack occur@@ red.
these show con@@ vo@@ ys of heavy weap@@ ons moving on the pen@@ insul@@ a, including mis@@ s@@ ile systems intended for coast@@ al def@@ en@@ se.
a dist@@ urb@@ ingly familiar Russian es@@ cal@@ ation
some reports indicate that Russi@@ a's tro@@ op@@ s in Cri@@ me@@ a were already sched@@ ul@@ ed for a new rot@@ ation about now, which would help explain the activ@@ ity, though it would be quite a co@@ inc@@ idence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest ten@@ sions since the 2014 ann@@ ex@@ ation.
whatever tran@@ sp@@ ired over the week@@ end, Mr. P@@ uti@@ n has un@@ ques@@ tion@@ ably es@@ cal@@ ated in his language toward Ukra@@ ine, choosing to use this ep@@ iso@@ de - howe@@ ver real it was - for some larger aim@@ .
analy@@ sts have poin@@ ted out dist@@ urb@@ ing par@@ all@@ els with how Russia be@@ ha@@ ved just before previous military actions against Ukra@@ ine.
in February 2014, similar spe@@ ech@@ es and military man@@ eu@@ vers provided cover for Cri@@ mean volunte@@ er mil@@ iti@@ as to se@@ ize the pen@@ insul@@ a, then still controlled by Ukra@@ ine, only to reve@@ al they were in fact Russian special forces laun@@ ching a military occup@@ ation.
that Aug@@ ust, as Russi@@ an-@@ back@@ ed separ@@ ati@@ sts lost ground in e@@ astern Ukra@@ ine, Mr. P@@ uti@@ n st@@ ation@@ ed tro@@ op@@ s along the b@@ order, war@@ ning they might be necessary to "@@ protec@@ t@@ " eth@@ nic Russian ci@@ v@@ ili@@ ans in Ukra@@ ine who he said were under attack@@ .
he or@@ ches@@ tr@@ ated an aid con@@ vo@@ y into the region that, according to N@@ AT@@ O@@ , was mere cover for a Russian inv@@ as@@ ion forc@@ e.
what is Mr. P@@ uti@@ n planning in Cri@@ me@@ a?
some have wonder@@ ed whether Moscow might be p@@ lot@@ ting another inter@@ ven@@ tion.
fi@@ ghting has increased in e@@ astern Ukra@@ ine, as it did before the August 2014 incur@@ sion.
but that seem@@ ing par@@ alle@@ l may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. P@@ uti@@ n le@@ verage with Ukra@@ ine and with Western countries.
mark Gal@@ e@@ ot@@ ti@@ , a New York University prof@@ essor who studies Russi@@ a, poin@@ ted out that Cri@@ me@@ a would make little sense as a st@@ aging ground for military action against e@@ astern Ukra@@ ine, which b@@ orders main@@ land Russia but not Cri@@ me@@ a, and that the rest of the country is better def@@ end@@ ed.
"@@ it's highly unlikely that the Russi@@ ans are truly planning some major off@@ ensi@@ ve@@ ," Mr. Gal@@ e@@ o@@ tt@@ i said.
ra@@ ther, "@@ We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up ten@@ sion@@ ."
international peace tal@@ ks over Ukra@@ ine, once the mechanism by which Mr. P@@ uti@@ n forced contact with Western leaders who had sh@@ un@@ ned him over ann@@ ex@@ ing Cri@@ me@@ a, have become increasingly regard@@ ed as fru@@ it@@ less and ir@@ relev@@ ant.
by dang@@ ling the thre@@ at of renew@@ ed conflic@@ t, Mr. P@@ uti@@ n gives the tal@@ ks a new purpo@@ se@@ : to co@@ ax him back from the br@@ in@@ k.
"@@ it's a standard P@@ uti@@ n tac@@ tic - he wants to try to go there from a position of streng@@ th@@ ," Mr. Gal@@ e@@ o@@ tt@@ i said of the next peace tal@@ ks, plan@@ ned for early Septem@@ ber.
"@@ and the only real strength is to say@@ ," I could make things mu@@ ch, much wor@@ se if I wanted to. "@@ "
position@@ ing for a bar@@ gain with the West
Mr. P@@ uti@@ n also said this week that it made little sense to continue negoti@@ ations am@@ id the Cri@@ me@@ a ten@@ sions, forc@@ ing the other parties to per@@ su@@ ade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process.
what does this actually get him@@ ?
for one, it allows Russia to continue ass@@ er@@ ting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australi@@ a@@ '@@ s.
for an@@ other, it positions Moscow as having a ve@@ to over Ukra@@ ine@@ 's so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control.
it may also serve Mr. P@@ ut@@ in@@ 's long-@@ held ho@@ pes of a gr@@ and bar@@ gain with the United States that would set@@ tle their disputes over Ukra@@ ine and Sy@@ ria - on terms favor@@ able to Mo@@ sc@@ ow, natur@@ ally - as well as ending Western sanc@@ tions against Russi@@ a.
Mr. P@@ uti@@ n has repe@@ ated@@ ly h@@ in@@ ted at this goal since his nation@@ 's economy began coll@@ ap@@ sing in late 2014, due mostly to the dec@@ lin@@ ing value of its oil and gas ex@@ port@@ s.
since inter@@ ven@@ ing in Sy@@ ria last f@@ all, he has repe@@ ated@@ ly invi@@ ted Western pow@@ ers to join him in a gr@@ and co@@ ali@@ tion to fight extrem@@ ist@@ s.
but Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before Jan@@ u@@ ary, when President Ob@@ ama will leave offic@@ e.
Russian offici@@ als tend to view Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton as the likely success@@ or and as more ho@@ sti@@ le to Mo@@ sc@@ ow@@ .
Don@@ ald J@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p, while con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously friendly toward Russi@@ a, is still seen as un@@ predic@@ table.
but Mr. Ob@@ ama is seen as "@@ looking for resolu@@ tions, not conflic@@ ts@@ ," Mr. Gal@@ e@@ o@@ tt@@ i said.
so there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quick@@ ly.
in the mean@@ time, should no gr@@ and bar@@ gain come, Mr. P@@ uti@@ n appears happy to keep Russi@@ a's weak@@ er neigh@@ b@@ or gu@@ ess@@ ing about wh@@ at's coming nex@@ t.
an earlier version of this article mis@@ stated the year that Russia ann@@ ex@@ ed Cri@@ me@@ a from Ukra@@ ine.
it was 2014, not 201@@ 3.
with Congress dead@@ lock@@ ed, White House di@@ ver@@ ts Fun@@ ds to Fi@@ ght Z@@ i@@ ka
the Ob@@ ama administration on Th@@ urs@@ day said it was shif@@ ting $@@ 8@@ 1 million away from bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical research and anti@@ po@@ ver@@ ty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Z@@ i@@ ka v@@ acc@@ ine, resor@@ ting to ex@@ tra@@ ordinary measures because Congress has fail@@ ed to appro@@ ve new fun@@ ding to comb@@ at the vir@@ us.
Sy@@ l@@ via Ma@@ the@@ w@@ s Bur@@ well, the sec@@ ret@@ ary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the di@@ ver@@ ted fun@@ ds, the National In@@ stitu@@ tes of Health and the Bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to con@@ front the mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o-@@ bor@@ ne ill@@ ness by the end of the mon@@ th.
that would force the development of a v@@ acc@@ ine to stop at a critical time, as loc@@ ally acquired cases of Z@@ i@@ ka inf@@ ection increase in Mi@@ am@@ i.
as of last wee@@ k, 7@@ ,@@ 3@@ 50 cases of Z@@ i@@ ka had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Ric@@ o, according to the Center@@ s for Dis@@ ease Control and Pre@@ ven@@ tion.
M@@ s. Bur@@ well said that 15 inf@@ ants had been born with Z@@ ik@@ a-@@ related birth def@@ ec@@ ts.
the virus can cause ab@@ normal brain development and other serious def@@ ects in children born to inf@@ ected mother@@ s.
the local spread of the ill@@ ness in the contin@@ ental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political st@@ ak@@ es surrounding the fed@@ eral govern@@ ment@@ 's respon@@ se.
Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton on Tu@@ es@@ day made a campa@@ ign stop in W@@ yn@@ woo@@ d, the Miami neighbor@@ hood that has had a r@@ ash of loc@@ ally transmitted Z@@ i@@ ka cases, and pressed Congress to return from its fi@@ ve-@@ week break to appro@@ ve emergency fun@@ ding to fight the vir@@ us.
President Ob@@ ama and con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al Republic@@ ans have been at od@@ ds for most of the year over Z@@ ik@@ a.
in Febr@@ u@@ ary, Mr. Ob@@ ama requested $@@ 1.@@ 9 billion in emergency fun@@ d@@ ing.
Republic@@ ans bal@@ k@@ ed, dem@@ anding a more detailed accoun@@ ting of where the money would go.
law@@ makers have fe@@ uded for months over how much money should be ear@@ marked and how it should be sp@@ ent.
last month, Democr@@ ats bloc@@ ked consideration of a Republic@@ an measure that would have al@@ located $@@ 1.1 billion to fight Z@@ i@@ ka but included provisions that would have ban@@ ned fun@@ ding for Plan@@ ned P@@ aren@@ th@@ ood to provide contrac@@ eption related to the vir@@ us, which can be sex@@ ually transmit@@ ted.
the dead@@ lock promp@@ ted the White House in April to shi@@ ft $@@ 58@@ 9 million in E@@ bol@@ a fun@@ ding to the Z@@ i@@ ka effor@@ t, about two-@@ thir@@ ds of it designated for domestic use.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, M@@ s. Bur@@ well said that her department had used most of that mone@@ y, and that it would be gone by the end of Aug@@ ust@@ .
"the failure to pass a Z@@ i@@ ka emergency supple@@ mental has forced the administration to choose between del@@ ay@@ ing critical v@@ acc@@ ine development work and ra@@ iding other wor@@ thy government programs to temporarily avoid these del@@ ay@@ s," M@@ s. Bur@@ well wro@@ te.
Democr@@ ats se@@ ized on the announc@@ ement to ber@@ ate Republic@@ ans for fail@@ ing to provide additional money for Z@@ ik@@ a.
at a news confer@@ ence, Representative N@@ ancy P@@ el@@ os@@ i of Californi@@ a, the min@@ ority lead@@ er, called on Representative Paul D. R@@ y@@ an, the House speak@@ er, to bring Congress back to advance such a meas@@ ure.
"@@ every possible option is being exha@@ us@@ ted, and now we're going into the National In@@ stitu@@ tes of Heal@@ th, which is sup@@ posed to be a pri@@ or@@ ity@@ ," M@@ s. P@@ el@@ os@@ i said.
a@@ ides to Mr. R@@ y@@ an said that shif@@ ting the funds was a long-@@ over@@ due step that the Ob@@ ama administration had del@@ ayed to squ@@ ee@@ ze maximum political advantage out of the Z@@ i@@ ka issu@@ e.
the National In@@ stitu@@ tes of Health announced last week that it had be@@ gun clinical tri@@ als of a Z@@ i@@ ka v@@ acc@@ ine on 80 human subjec@@ ts, and ho@@ ped to begin a second phase in "@@ Z@@ ik@@ a-@@ end@@ em@@ ic countri@@ es" in early 201@@ 7.
but without more fun@@ ding now, offici@@ als said Th@@ urs@@ day, the research would hal@@ t in its track@@ s.
M@@ s. Bur@@ well said she would transfer to the Z@@ i@@ ka efforts $3@@ 4 million in N@@ .@@ I@@ .@@ H@@ . funds that had been designated to find treat@@ ments for other diseas@@ es, including cancer and di@@ abe@@ tes.
another $@@ 47 million will be transferred to the Bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical Advanced Research and Development Auth@@ or@@ ity, which supports the development of dru@@ gs and v@@ acc@@ ines to respond to public health emerg@@ enci@@ es.
that money will come out of a variety of accoun@@ ts, including $@@ 19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidi@@ es for low-@@ income families and $@@ 4 million from subst@@ ance ab@@ use programs such as those for op@@ i@@ oid add@@ ic@@ tion.
even then, M@@ s. Bur@@ well said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point ag@@ encies would have to "@@ sever@@ ely cur@@ tail many of their critical effor@@ ts@@ " against Z@@ i@@ ka without action from Con@@ gres@@ s.
in the last four months, the Center@@ s for Dis@@ ease Control and Pre@@ vention spent $@@ 60 million to help states protect pregn@@ ant wom@@ en, $@@ 25 million to strengthen their Z@@ i@@ ka prep@@ are@@ d@@ ness and response plan@@ s, and $@@ 16 million to help them create dat@@ a-@@ collection systems to quickly detec@@ t micro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ y and other Z@@ ik@@ a-@@ related syn@@ dro@@ m@@ es.
Thai Lead@@ er Links A@@ tt@@ acks on Tourist Sites to Con@@ stitu@@ tion Change
the head of the Thai j@@ un@@ ta urg@@ ed his countr@@ y@@ men on Fri@@ day to have pati@@ ence while investig@@ ators determine who was behind a wave of dead@@ ly b@@ omb@@ ings in Thailand this wee@@ k.
G@@ en. Pr@@ ay@@ u@@ th Ch@@ an-@@ o@@ ch@@ a, the j@@ un@@ ta chief and pri@@ me minist@@ er, h@@ in@@ ted that the perpet@@ r@@ ators were "@@ bad people@@ " op@@ posed to a new Con@@ stitu@@ tion that was approved by vo@@ ters on Sunday in a nation@@ wide refer@@ end@@ um.
"@@ there are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the refer@@ end@@ um@@ ," he said in an address to the n@@ ation.
the b@@ omb@@ ings in five provinc@@ es on Th@@ urs@@ day and Fri@@ day, including in Phuket and Hu@@ a H@@ in, areas popular with tou@@ rist@@ s, killed four people and inj@@ ured do@@ z@@ ens.
the authorities said ar@@ son attacks else@@ where in the country appeared to be rel@@ ated.
analy@@ sts said the b@@ omb@@ ings did not appear to be aim@@ ed at k@@ illing many people, but rather at dam@@ aging the tour@@ ism industry, one of the few bright spo@@ ts in Thail@@ and@@ 's econom@@ y.
at least n@@ ine foreign visitors were inj@@ ured in Hu@@ a H@@ in.
"@@ whatever the mo@@ tives are, the explo@@ sions and ar@@ son attacks under@@ mine the j@@ un@@ ta@@ 's claim that the post@@ -@@ refer@@ end@@ um situation would be st@@ able@@ ," said Sun@@ ai Ph@@ as@@ u@@ k, a senior research@@ er at Human Rights Wat@@ ch.
these attacks create effects that dis@@ credit the authori@@ ties, terror@@ ize the public and har@@ m the tour@@ ism@@ -based econom@@ y.
photo Thai res@@ c@@ ue workers treated a vic@@ ti@@ m inj@@ ured by a b@@ om@@ b that explo@@ ded in Hu@@ a H@@ in on Fri@@ day.
the police said they did not believe that the b@@ omb@@ ings were ti@@ ed to international terror@@ ism or to a long-@@ running Islam@@ ic insur@@ g@@ ency in southern Thail@@ and.
they have por@@ tr@@ ayed the attacks as "@@ local s@@ abo@@ t@@ age@@ ," not terror@@ ism.
the tim@@ ing and location of the attacks carried strong political sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ ism.
the b@@ omb@@ ings occur@@ red as people prepared to celebr@@ ate the birth@@ day of Queen Si@@ ri@@ k@@ it on Fri@@ day, which is considered Mo@@ ther@@ 's Day in Thail@@ and.
four b@@ om@@ bs struc@@ k the ro@@ yal resid@@ ential town of Hu@@ a H@@ in, about 12@@ 5 miles from Bangko@@ k, where most injur@@ ies occur@@ red.
the mil@@ it@@ ar@@ y-@@ dra@@ f@@ ted Con@@ stitu@@ tion will di@@ min@@ ish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it retur@@ ns the government to ci@@ v@@ ilian control.
the j@@ un@@ ta helped ensure its vic@@ tory by pre@@ vent@@ ing op@@ pon@@ ents from campa@@ ig@@ ning against it.
the b@@ omb@@ ings were "@@ clearly coordin@@ ated but ob@@ vi@@ ously intended to create fear and anxi@@ ety rather than mas@@ sive damage and death@@ s and injur@@ i@@ es@@ ," he said.
last year, a b@@ om@@ bing at the popular E@@ re@@ w@@ an sh@@ r@@ ine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tou@@ rists from China.
Thai offici@@ als attribu@@ ted the b@@ om@@ bing to U@@ igh@@ ur mil@@ it@@ ants ang@@ ry over the return of more than 100 U@@ igh@@ urs to China.
General Pr@@ ay@@ u@@ th, who has led the j@@ un@@ ta since a 2014 cou@@ p ous@@ ted a ci@@ v@@ ilian govern@@ ment, said this week@@ 's b@@ omb@@ ings "@@ hur@@ t the heart@@ s" of Thai people.
"@@ why now, when the country is getting bet@@ ter, the economy is getting bet@@ ter, and tour@@ ism is getting bet@@ ter@@ ?" he said.
we have to ask wh@@ y, and who did it.

two years ago, 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old Ser@@ gi@@ o Ur@@ reg@@ o jum@@ ped to his death from a shopping center in Bo@@ got@@ á@@ , leaving as his su@@ ic@@ ide note a Facebook post quo@@ ting P@@ ink Flo@@ y@@ d@@ 's "@@ Goo@@ d@@ b@@ ye Cru@@ el World@@ ."
his death was the gen@@ es@@ is of a contro@@ vers@@ y that ro@@ iled Colombi@@ a this wee@@ k, as the effort to expand L@@ .@@ G@@ .@@ B@@ .@@ T@@ . rights was draw@@ n into a broad@@ er political fight that has pol@@ ar@@ ized the n@@ ation.
after his death@@ , Mr. Ur@@ re@@ go@@ 's mother, Al@@ ba Re@@ y@@ es, su@@ ed school offici@@ als, fa@@ ul@@ ting them for o@@ str@@ ac@@ izing her only son after dis@@ covering that he and a class@@ mate had an in@@ timate relation@@ ship.
a year later, Colombi@@ a's highest court issued a swe@@ eping rul@@ ing in her fav@@ or, calling on schools nation@@ wide to develop cle@@ are@@ r policies to prevent discrimin@@ ation.
the decision was part of a string of legal vic@@ tor@@ ies for Colombi@@ a's g@@ ay rights move@@ ment, which earlier this year celebr@@ ated a decision that leg@@ alized sam@@ e-@@ sex marri@@ age.
this wee@@ k, though@@ , their fight for equ@@ ality hit an ob@@ st@@ acle as G@@ ina Par@@ od@@ y, the min@@ ister of education - who is open@@ ly g@@ ay - became the fl@@ ash@@ point of a sc@@ and@@ al over the implementation of the rul@@ ing.
the fr@@ ac@@ as started when sex@@ ually ex@@ plic@@ it content from a por@@ no@@ graphic magaz@@ ine began cir@@ cul@@ ating on social medi@@ a, ped@@ d@@ led by people who claim@@ ed it was part of a guid@@ ance manual issued by the education ministr@@ y.
M@@ s. Par@@ od@@ y quickly de@@ bun@@ ked that.
while the ministr@@ y offered guid@@ ance to schools on issues related to sexual ori@@ ent@@ ation and g@@ ender identi@@ ty in an effort to help them he@@ ed the rul@@ ing, it has not sought to im@@ pose stand@@ ardi@@ zed rul@@ es.
"@@ what we want is for schools to have the tools to resol@@ ve conflic@@ ts@@ ," M@@ s. Par@@ od@@ y said in an inter@@ view on Th@@ urs@@ day.
the dispute opened a new front in a national deb@@ ate over the future of a country tor@@ n over peace negoti@@ ations between the government and the Re@@ volu@@ tionary Ar@@ med For@@ ces of Colombia, or the F@@ AR@@ C, a gu@@ err@@ illa grou@@ p.
a co@@ ali@@ tion of poli@@ tic@@ i@@ ans op@@ posed to the government and leaders of the Cath@@ olic Church mobil@@ ized with ex@@ tra@@ ordinary spe@@ ed, acc@@ using the government of President Ju@@ an Man@@ u@@ el San@@ to@@ s of promoting sam@@ e-@@ sex un@@ ions and g@@ ender flu@@ id@@ ity.
to com@@ plic@@ ate mat@@ ters, the government dele@@ gation negoti@@ ating with the F@@ AR@@ C in H@@ av@@ ana recently reached an acc@@ ord on g@@ ender and L@@ .@@ G@@ .@@ B@@ .@@ T@@ . equ@@ ality that calls on the government to adop@@ t more inclusive polici@@ es.

M@@ s. Par@@ od@@ y remained ad@@ mir@@ ably sto@@ ic throughout the br@@ u@@ ising week as she sought to set the record straight and rec@@ ast the deb@@ ate on construc@@ tive ter@@ ms.
"@@ part of what has kept me standing and clear@@ -@@ head@@ ed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the clo@@ set@@ ," she said.
this is a tou@@ gh stage and a very l@@ on@@ ely time.
as Colombi@@ ans continue to we@@ igh the mer@@ its of a deal with the F@@ AR@@ C, which would mark an se@@ ism@@ ic turning point for the country, they must consider the ro@@ o@@ ts of the conflic@@ t, she said.
"@@ is a peaceful country one that promo@@ tes incl@@ usion or excl@@ us@@ ion@@ ; is it one in which everyone has equal opport@@ uni@@ ti@@ es@@ ?" she said.
while she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insul@@ ts and har@@ ass@@ ment this wee@@ k, she is gl@@ ad that in today's Colombia, g@@ ay students can look up to her and consider that the@@ y, too, can asp@@ ire to serve as a min@@ ister one day.

the UK government recently announced suddenly the suspension of the project of H@@ ink@@ ley Point N@@ uclear Power Station in the UK in partnership with China and France, attrac@@ ting a wide spread attention at home and ab@@ ro@@ ad.
a UK government spo@@ k@@ es@@ man recently said that the de@@ fer@@ r@@ al of the project does not mean the UK has ch@@ illed its enthusi@@ as@@ m for China, as China and the UK are still co@@ operating in a wide range of sec@@ tors and the UK will continue to seek to maintain the strong partnership with China.
some experts poin@@ ted out that China's nuclear power leads the world in technical level, safety performance, operating experience and all other asp@@ ec@@ ts, as well as has relatively low cost@@ s.
therefore, although "@@ N@@ uclear Power Go@@ ing G@@ lob@@ al@@ " will experience tri@@ als and tri@@ bul@@ ations in a given perio@@ d, the trend of mut@@ ually bene@@ fic@@ ial cooperation between the parties will not be changed in the context of huge win@@ -@@ win potenti@@ al.
but these words clearly do not hold true for what the UK did in the project of H@@ ink@@ ley Point N@@ uclear Power Station.
once the project is comple@@ ted, it will meet 7 percent of the UK@@ 's power demands and help reduce 9 million tons of carbon di@@ ox@@ ide ann@@ ually in the operation period of 60 years.
analy@@ sts generally believe that com@@ plic@@ ated factors in the UK such as exposed economic ris@@ ks, increasing disputes among domestic poli@@ tics, c@@ um@@ ber@@ some subsequent procedures after Bre@@ x@@ it, and increasing future un@@ certain@@ ties all imp@@ ed@@ e its nuclear power projec@@ ts.
"@@ curren@@ t@@ ly, since property prices in the UK are fall@@ ing and out@@ flow of capital starts occur@@ r@@ ing, keeping domestic economy and market system stable has been the top priority of the UK@@ 's new govern@@ ment.
mean@@ while, after the approval of Bre@@ x@@ it vo@@ te, the UK also needs to face a number of Bre@@ x@@ it procedures in the coming days and strai@@ gh@@ ten out its relationship with EU countries like France again.
X@@ u M@@ ing@@ qi said that though the UK@@ 's new government shows app@@ aren@@ t e@@ ag@@ er@@ ness to "@@ differ@@ enti@@ ate from@@ " the previous govern@@ ment, it does not den@@ y the positive signific@@ ance of nuclear power projec@@ ts.
over the past two dec@@ ad@@ es, however, the UK has seen the st@@ ag@@ nation of the development of its nuclear power, and a majority of its existing 15 nuclear power stations have reached their design life@@ time.
according to the predic@@ tion of the UK@@ 's Energy White Pap@@ er, there will be only one nuclear power station still in service in the UK by 20@@ 25, leading to major g@@ aps in electric power suppl@@ y.
for this reason, the parties express their common concer@@ ns about the suspension of this project benef@@ iting the public wel@@ fare by the UK govern@@ ment.
Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ oming said that we look forward to successfully starting and imple@@ menting the project as early as possib@@ le, providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energ@@ y.
according to insi@@ der@@ s, projects of nuclear power stations are instru@@ mental in the reduction of electricity cost for the British public@@ , while at the same time driving local economy and employ@@ ment.
so, if the UK@@ 's new government makes a final decision from the pro@@ spec@@ tive of maxim@@ izing its people's wel@@ f@@ are, nuclear power projects will not see a g@@ loom@@ y out@@ loo@@ k.
the UK side can address energy demand g@@ ap@@ , and the sides of both China and France can find the market for their own advant@@ age@@ ous technologies and products in the field of nuclear power, benef@@ iting more people. "
in sp@@ ite of the increasing un@@ certain@@ ty of the H@@ ink@@ ley Point N@@ uclear Power Station projec@@ t, there is no doubt about China's high-@@ level and sophistic@@ ated experience in nuclear power technology.
taking China's "@@ Hu@@ along 1@@ " that will enter the British nuclear power market as sched@@ ul@@ ed as an example, it incorpor@@ ates the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technologies and dre@@ w previous experience in design.
for instance, China has designed the "@@ pas@@ sive resid@@ ual heat removal system at the second@@ ary side of v@@ ap@@ or gener@@ ator@@ " based on problems refl@@ ected in Japan@@ 's Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a nuclear accid@@ ent, which can remove the heat from re@@ ac@@ tor co@@ res in time, avo@@ iding the mel@@ t@@ down of re@@ ac@@ tor co@@ res.
Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ oming said that China has been keeping a good track record and safety level during the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years, and international institutions set a high value on the achiev@@ ements it has made in nuclear power development and regul@@ ator@@ y.
it is now an important historic moment for the relationship between China and the UK, so mutual respect and trust are more valuable than ever@@ .
"@@ following the change of president of Argent@@ in@@ a, the China-@@ Argent@@ ina nuclear power station project was also laid as@@ ide tempor@@ ar@@ il@@ y, but it has now been clearly sched@@ ul@@ ed to begin construction in the first quarter of next year@@ ."
since the on@@ set of this sum@@ m@@ er, the temperature in our city is at an all@@ -time high@@ , so swimming has been a go@@ -@@ to choice for many citizens to enjoy the c@@ ool and reli@@ eve summer he@@ at, particularly in the swimming pool in the Gu@@ i@@ jiang River which attrac@@ ts a great number of citizens to come.
according to the staff of the swimming pool, a my@@ ri@@ ad of citizens or people together with their child come here in succ@@ ession from 4@@ pm every day, and then the w@@ ad@@ ing pool and middle pool are always j@@ am@@ -@@ pack@@ ed with people.
this beautiful and broad@@ -@@ wat@@ ers swimming pool in the river is very popular with many sw@@ im@@ mer@@ s.
the 9@@ th China-@@ AS@@ E@@ AN Education Exchange We@@ ek will offici@@ ally enter the extended period from August 8 and host 70 activities throughout the year.
in the previous opening perio@@ d, government offici@@ als, presid@@ ents from col@@ leg@@ es and universi@@ ties, experts and schol@@ ars ali@@ ke from China and 10 AS@@ E@@ AN countries conducted effective ex@@ changes in plans for educational development.
in recent years, China and AS@@ E@@ AN countries has been increasingly deep@@ ening ex@@ changes and cooperation in all domain@@ s, and constantly launched high@@ lights in educational cooper@@ ation.
it is understood that, during the education exchange We@@ ek held by the two parties for years in a row@@ , nearly 800 cooperation agre@@ ements were sign@@ ed, continuously enabling win@@ -@@ win cooperation in people@@ -to-@@ people ex@@ change.
in this exchange year, as fl@@ ag@@ ship programs of the Education Year@@ , the 9@@ th China-@@ AS@@ E@@ AN Education Exchange We@@ ek and the 2nd China-@@ AS@@ E@@ AN Education Min@@ ist@@ ers R@@ ound T@@ able were of particular concer@@ n.

the "@@ China-@@ AS@@ E@@ AN Education Exchange Year@@ " that has been held for years running provides a goal of closer regional education cooperation for building the "@@ China-@@ AS@@ E@@ AN Community of Sha@@ red Fut@@ ure@@ ."
"the China-@@ AS@@ E@@ AN Education Exchange We@@ ek plays an ir@@ replac@@ e@@ able role in deep@@ ening human@@ -@@ oriented exchange between the two parties and er@@ ecting the@@ " Bridge of S@@ oul@@ , Bridge of Friend@@ ship, Bridge of Under@@ stand@@ ing. "
to@@ day, the attention paid by people to tum@@ ors is increasing rapid@@ ly, which in a large part might be linked to cancer inc@@ idence at a high level in recent years.
according to reports about cancer in 201@@ 2, there were about 3.@@ 37 million new cancer cases and some 2.@@ 11 million death cases in China every year.
due to its un@@ controlled growth and pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation, can@@ er can affect nearly every part of human body.
generally speak@@ ing, any part of human body might suff@@ er from canc@@ er, and some kinds of canc@@ ers will also be transferred to other part of the body.
cancer is a gen@@ e@@ tic diseas@@ e, but studies found that only a small number of canc@@ ers are gen@@ e@@ tic@@ .
many factors can affect the oc@@ curren@@ ce and development of canc@@ ers, among which environmental factors are on top of the list and can be chang@@ ed.
environmental factors include smo@@ king, infec@@ ti@@ ous fac@@ tors, radi@@ ation, pollu@@ tion as well as foo@@ ds, nutri@@ tion, and physical activities, etc.
after Mr. Li was sent to the hospit@@ al, the doc@@ tor told his family members that he was in a serious situation because he was in a hyper@@ o@@ sm@@ ol@@ ar com@@ a caused by severe de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation as a result of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a, and he might die if sent here a few minutes lat@@ er.
according to statis@@ tics, the sy@@ mp@@ tom of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a might be found in some 20@@ % of di@@ abe@@ tics, particularly previously un@@ treated patients or those whose blood gl@@ uc@@ ose has not been controlled proper@@ ly.
for some di@@ abe@@ tics, chron@@ ic di@@ arr@@ he@@ a might even the primary disease sy@@ mptom@@ , which is so dec@@ ep@@ tive and then leads to mis@@ sed diagno@@ sis and mis@@ diagno@@ se.
ad@@ dition@@ ally, when some hypo@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic dru@@ gs such as mel@@ b@@ ine (@@ D@@ MB@@ G@@ ) or α@@ -@@ gl@@ uc@@ o@@ sid@@ ase in@@ hi@@ b@@ itor are taken at very on@@ set, patients might happen to side effects like ab@@ dom@@ inal dis@@ ten@@ sion, ab@@ dom@@ inal pain and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a.
this is because stress hyper@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ia together with hypo@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ia condition might occur after di@@ arr@@ he@@ a in case of infl@@ amm@@ ation.
more@@ over, human body is in a stress situation due to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a, rele@@ as@@ ing multiple hor@@ mon@@ es. while its con@@ fron@@ t@@ ation with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a, human body will also suff@@ er from much blood gl@@ uc@@ ose that out@@ flow@@ s, which might cause ket@@ o@@ ac@@ id@@ os@@ is in severe cas@@ es.
therefore, in addition to e@@ ti@@ ological treatment in hospit@@ al, di@@ abe@@ tics should also pay attention to the following asp@@ ects after di@@ arr@@ he@@ a.
di@@ abe@@ tics suffering from ac@@ ute di@@ arr@@ he@@ a must prevent de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation first, so it is necessary to drink more water, which natur@@ ally helps them with more ur@@ in@@ ation, allowing for dra@@ ining un@@ necessary blood gl@@ uc@@ ose as well as ac@@ et@@ one bodi@@ es.
according to a pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary environmental assess@@ ment report released by the F@@ DA in Mar@@ ch, this kind of mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to will not significantly affect the environment.
the report also noted that, however, this did not mean this kind of mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to can be used for commercial purpose.
Ox@@ ite@@ c also must follow other regulations specified by the fed@@ er@@ al, state and local govern@@ ments, and work together with its local partner Florida Key@@ s Mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to Control District to determine the time of conduc@@ ting field test@@ s.
tests conducted in Braz@@ il, Pan@@ ama and C@@ ay@@ man Islands showed that this kind of mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to can reduce the number of mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es in test areas by more than 90@@ %.

police had ar@@ res@@ ted 12 people before Th@@ urs@@ day@@ 's oper@@ ation, all susp@@ ected of collaboration with Islam@@ ic State mil@@ it@@ ants.
Braz@@ il@@ 's fed@@ eral police said three others have been inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated and later rele@@ as@@ ed.
the two ar@@ res@@ ted on Th@@ urs@@ day were Braz@@ ili@@ ans, but police did not provide names or other details.
although Brazil has no history of conflict with known mil@@ it@@ ant grou@@ ps, the government has said the Games made the country a more likely tar@@ get@@ , particularly because of participation by countries fi@@ ghting Islam@@ ic State@@ .
its mil@@ it@@ ants control parts of I@@ ra@@ q and Sy@@ ria and a U.@@ S.@@ -@@ led co@@ ali@@ tion has conducted air stri@@ kes against them.
the group has sup@@ por@@ ters worldwide who have carried out sho@@ ot@@ ings and b@@ omb@@ ings of ci@@ v@@ ili@@ ans.
new suspect in French pri@@ est k@@ illing form@@ ally charged
a man under ar@@ rest since Mon@@ day as part of the investig@@ ation into the k@@ illing of a French pri@@ est last month has been placed under form@@ al investig@@ ation, a police source told Re@@ u@@ ters on Fri@@ day.
the 2@@ 1-@@ year old suspect is under investig@@ ation for collaboration with terror@@ ists and was planning attacks on people, the source said.
the man had been in telephone contact with A@@ del Ker@@ mic@@ he and Ab@@ del M@@ ali@@ k Pe@@ tit@@ je@@ an, who interrup@@ ted a church service in Saint-@@ E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne@@ -@@ du@@ -@@ Rou@@ v@@ r@@ ay, western France, on July 26@@ , and sli@@ t the thro@@ at of 8@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old Roman Cath@@ olic pri@@ est Father J@@ acqu@@ es Ham@@ el.
the suspect had travel@@ ed from his home town near T@@ oul@@ ouse to Saint-@@ E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne@@ -@@ du@@ -@@ Rou@@ v@@ ray and spent the night there in the days before the attack@@ , the source said.
the young man, who has no criminal record@@ , has ack@@ now@@ ledg@@ ed having spent the night there but told investig@@ ators that he had left the next day because he did not had a good relationship with Ker@@ mic@@ he and Pe@@ tit@@ je@@ an, the source said.
investig@@ ators are trying to establish whether Ker@@ mic@@ he and Pe@@ tit@@ je@@ an had accompl@@ ices in France and whether they had links with Islam@@ ic St@@ ate, which has claim@@ ed responsibility for the attack@@ .
a c@@ ous@@ in of Pe@@ tit@@ je@@ an was also placed in prev@@ enti@@ ve de@@ tention at the end of last mon@@ th.
Dor@@ us de V@@ ries under@@ goes medical ahead of Cel@@ tic move

he made 51 appear@@ ances for the Sw@@ ans as they won promotion to the Premier Le@@ ague under Ro@@ dg@@ ers in 201@@ 1.
he qu@@ it the Wel@@ sh out@@ fit that summer to join Wol@@ ves and has been at the City Gr@@ ound since 201@@ 3.
he also has experience of playing in Scot@@ land after sp@@ ending a season with D@@ un@@ fer@@ m@@ line after sig@@ ning back in 200@@ 6.
his East End Park stay ended in dis@@ appoint@@ ment, however, as the Par@@ s suffer@@ ed the double ag@@ ony of being re@@ leg@@ ated from the top-@@ flight before lo@@ sing out to Cel@@ tic in the final of the Scot@@ tish C@@ up.

during Rio 2016 Olympic Gam@@ es, security issue has been what people care about all the time, and people under@@ went another b@@ om@@ b f@@ right before a men@@ 's bas@@ ket@@ ball game this mor@@ ning.
the Rio Olymp@@ ics organiz@@ ing commit@@ tee confir@@ ms that the police working together with the military have det@@ on@@ ated a susp@@ icious k@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ ack found in the bas@@ ket@@ ball st@@ adi@@ um under control before the bas@@ ket@@ ball game between Spain and N@@ ig@@ eria k@@ ic@@ ked off@@ .
a security guard told Re@@ u@@ ters that this susp@@ icious k@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ ack was found after the end of the bas@@ ket@@ ball game between Brazil and Croati@@ a.
after@@ ward@@ s, the k@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ ack was carried away by a robo@@ t which then det@@ on@@ ated it under the guid@@ ance of the police and mil@@ it@@ ary.
the statement also men@@ tion@@ ed, "@@ There is a table@@ t, a pair of soc@@ ks and a jack@@ et in the k@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ ack@@ ."
as the game between Spain and N@@ ig@@ eria k@@ ic@@ ked off, there were no spec@@ t@@ ators in the st@@ adi@@ um, who were allowed to enter it after the security had been confirm@@ ed by the polic@@ e.
the Sp@@ ain@@ 's N@@ B@@ A super@@ star P@@ au G@@ as@@ ol said that the players got conf@@ used about the then condition for a time, "We heard the explo@@ sion, but did not know what happened on earth.
at the begin@@ ning, we just heard the explo@@ sion and then looked ar@@ ound, but found everything was O@@ K. "
there was also a susp@@ icious b@@ om@@ b thre@@ at in the previous men@@ 's road cycl@@ ing race at the Rio Olymp@@ ics, but fortun@@ ately, the b@@ omb@@ -@@ dis@@ pos@@ al squ@@ ad controlled and det@@ on@@ ated a susp@@ icious package near the fin@@ ishing line.
in sc@@ or@@ ching and sw@@ el@@ tering sum@@ m@@ er, an increasing number of skin problems will be found in inf@@ ants, which is closely linked to swe@@ ating more.
temperature rise means the beginning of night@@ m@@ are of many parents as their little baby starts suffering from itch@@ y sk@@ in, ac@@ compani@@ ed with symptoms such as red r@@ ash and red spo@@ t, thus ca@@ using them to constantly sc@@ rat@@ ch the skin and c@@ ry all the time at night.
in sp@@ ite of various causes of form@@ ation, the symptoms are all much of a mu@@ ch@@ ness, refl@@ ected in skin with red r@@ ash@@ es and red spot as well as itch@@ y sk@@ in.
as a matter of fact, the causes of these skin diseases are also quite simil@@ ar, that is, little kids are not that "@@ clean@@ " due to too much swe@@ at and s@@ ali@@ va that but is not removed in time, so that the "@@ cover@@ ed@@ " skin happens to diseas@@ es.
po@@ di@@ at@@ r@@ ist T@@ an Xi@@ ao@@ hu@@ a noted that little kids have much more del@@ ic@@ ate skin as well as more heat production and swe@@ at than ad@@ ul@@ ts.
pl@@ us, the swe@@ at g@@ land of little kids is in the development, and the swe@@ at g@@ land and der@@ mal g@@ land of some children have not been bal@@ anced y@@ et, leading to the in@@ ability to swe@@ at.
"@@ some parents have a good hab@@ it by car@@ rying a small tow@@ el with them and immediately wi@@ ping away the swe@@ at on their ki@@ d once found@@ ."
"@@ and for children often with wet clothes and swe@@ at, skin r@@ ash will often be found on their bod@@ y@@ ."
if the summer is too ho@@ t, bab@@ ies will swe@@ at too mu@@ ch, so parents can increase show@@ ering frequency for them and then put dry clothes on them.
for example, a shower for bab@@ ies is taken every day at ordinary times, and now it can be increased to twice a day. however, fl@@ ush@@ ing is just O@@ K in the second bath@@ , without the use of any bath suppli@@ es.
in addition, to prevent skin diseases in sum@@ m@@ er, anti-@@ mil@@ i@@ aria po@@ tion containing some her@@ b ingredi@@ ents like hon@@ e@@ ys@@ uck@@ le can be dri@@ pped into the bath water for bab@@ ies, which can help dis@@ per@@ se por@@ e and per@@ sp@@ i@@ re.
the above are ess@@ enti@@ als for parents to protect their kid@@ 's sk@@ in. for different skin diseas@@ es, parents can also adop@@ t the following different treatment metho@@ ds.
but keep in mind that if red r@@ ash@@ es are ac@@ compani@@ ed with pat@@ ches or repe@@ ated@@ ly attack@@ , it is recommended to see a doc@@ tor to check the possibility of other diseas@@ es.

on August 12, the re@@ por@@ ter learned from the Beijing War@@ ning Center that Mi@@ y@@ un District, F@@ ang@@ shan District and P@@ ing@@ g@@ u District issued ra@@ in@@ stor@@ m red and or@@ ange war@@ ning sign@@ als in succ@@ ession that day.
according to the Pro@@ pag@@ anda Department of the Mi@@ y@@ un District Commit@@ te@@ e, Mi@@ y@@ un District currently has sh@@ ut down 34 tour@@ ism scen@@ ic spo@@ ts and a sub@@ mer@@ sible bridge in D@@ aling Vill@@ age, Be@@ iz@@ hu@@ ang Town@@ , has been destro@@ y@@ ed.
at 10 am, August 12, Mi@@ y@@ un District issued a ra@@ in@@ stor@@ m red war@@ ning signal and a ge@@ ological dis@@ aster or@@ ange war@@ ning sign@@ al. and the ra@@ in@@ stor@@ m red war@@ ning signal was lif@@ ted at 2: 30 p@@ m.
it is estimated that there is still a th@@ under@@ shower or shower in Mi@@ y@@ un District from the late afterno@@ on to night that day, and mountain@@ ous areas and sh@@ allow mountain@@ ous areas will be at high risks of small and medi@@ um-@@ sized river f@@ loo@@ ds, mountain tor@@ ren@@ ts, ge@@ ological dis@@ aster and other second@@ ary dis@@ ast@@ ers arising from heavy ra@@ inf@@ all.

it is estimated that F@@ ang@@ shan District will still see a sustain@@ ed ra@@ inf@@ all and there will be ge@@ ological dis@@ aster risks in mountain@@ ous areas and sh@@ allow mountain@@ ous areas.
and according to the Beijing War@@ ning Center, an average preci@@ p@@ itation measured by the ra@@ inf@@ all monitoring stations across the city reached 20@@ m@@ m, with 13@@ .@@ 7@@ mm for urban area, from 6@@ : 00 am to 2: 00 pm on August 12@@ .
it is learned that at the time of the ste@@ am pipe break accid@@ ent, more than 20 persons were working on thermal energy de@@ bu@@ gging on site.
up to 3: 30 am on the morning of August 12, the w@@ ounded persons were still in the IC@@ U of D@@ ang@@ yang People's Hosp@@ ital for emergency treat@@ ment.
Mr. F@@ eng@@ , a family member of the w@@ ounded person Lu@@ o W@@ en, said that 90@@ % of his body has been scal@@ ded except hair and fe@@ et.
when Mr. F@@ eng saw Lu@@ o W@@ en, he was un@@ consci@@ ous due to serious injur@@ ies and doc@@ tors were saving his life.
it is understood that the five inj@@ ured workers all suff@@ er from scal@@ d@@ ing, some of whom are ac@@ compani@@ ed with injur@@ ies such as fr@@ ac@@ ture.

from the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12, there were 2 explo@@ sions on Phuket Is@@ land, 1 in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani and 1 in the south of Tr@@ ang other than 4 in Hu@@ a H@@ in, Ag@@ ence France Pres@@ se said.
it was previously reported that the first b@@ om@@ b explo@@ ded at local time 10 p@@ m, August 11, but no one was inj@@ ure@@ d.
the explo@@ sion of the second b@@ om@@ b killed one Thai woman and hur@@ t several fore@@ ign@@ ers and Thai people.
"@@ among the w@@ ounded persons there are 3 seri@@ ously inj@@ ured persons and 7 fore@@ ign@@ ers including 4 women and 3 men@@ ," said local polic@@ e.
after the accid@@ ent, the Thai police ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated the public and visitors near the explo@@ sion sites and sent the w@@ ounded persons to local hospit@@ als.
at pres@@ ent, the Thai police are investig@@ ating the mo@@ tiv@@ ation behind the explo@@ sion cases and what kind of b@@ om@@ b has been used.
located about 200 kilomet@@ ers away from the south of Bangko@@ k, the city is a summer resort for the Thai ro@@ yal house@@ hold, where there are a number of beautiful beach@@ es, national par@@ ks, historic sites and ru@@ ins of ro@@ yal house@@ hol@@ d.

O@@ gu@@ ch@@ i got 24 poin@@ ts, including 7 of 12 three-@@ po@@ inter@@ s and all the 3 free th@@ rows made but no sco@@ res from the field, Ak@@ og@@ non contribu@@ ted 12 points and 5 re@@ bound@@ s, and I@@ be@@ k@@ we sco@@ red 11 points and 5 re@@ bound@@ s.
as a traditional European te@@ am, Spain was sever@@ ely weak@@ ened by the ab@@ s@@ ence of its star player Mar@@ c G@@ as@@ ol, which had it on the ro@@ pes and even made it hard to advance from the grou@@ p.
facing the weak@@ est competi@@ tor N@@ ig@@ eria in the grou@@ p, Spain also played very hard and sc@@ rap@@ ed through the game at the elev@@ en@@ th hour@@ .
within the last 1 minute 20 seconds in this quar@@ ter, N@@ ig@@ eria fail@@ ed to score again, and Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z hit a three-@@ poin@@ ter to help Spain take a 25@@ -@@ 11 lead into the fir@@ st-@@ quarter break after 5 straight poin@@ ts.
when there were 3 '@@ 54 "@@ to go in the second quar@@ ter, G@@ as@@ ol made a driving lay@@ up to help Spain hold the lead at 40@@ -@@ 27@@ .
when there were 6 '@@ 0@@ 9 "@@ left in this quar@@ ter, L@@ l@@ ull hit two free th@@ rows for a 6@@ 1-@@ 48 Spain lead@@ , a two-@@ dig@@ it advantage once again.
after O@@ gu@@ chi@@ 's three-@@ poin@@ ter for N@@ ig@@ eri@@ a, Spain sco@@ red 4 straight points to exten@@ d its lead to 14@@ .
however, within the last 4 minutes 49 seconds in this quar@@ ter, Spain stopped sc@@ or@@ ing. on the contr@@ ary, N@@ ig@@ eria ended this quarter with a wave of 13@@ -@@ 0 including points in the pain@@ t and outside sho@@ ts for a 6@@ 6-@@ 65 lead@@ , the first in the whole game.
in this wave of attack@@ s, N@@ ig@@ eria hit two three-@@ po@@ inter@@ s and a f@@ oul outside the three-@@ poin@@ ter line.
when the game came to the last 3 '@@ 49 ", N@@ ig@@ eria closed to 7@@ 9-@@ 8@@ 1 after A@@ min@@ u added a lay@@ up.
after O@@ gu@@ chi@@ 's another three-@@ poin@@ ter helped N@@ ig@@ eria reduce the score dis@@ par@@ ity to 1, Re@@ y@@ es and G@@ as@@ ol who sco@@ red 6 straight points with free th@@ rows gave Spain an 8@@ 9-@@ 8@@ 2 lead as there were 1 '@@ 15 "@@ to go.
on the evening of August 12 Beijing Tim@@ e, Beijing Gu@@ o@@ an lost 1-@@ 2 to Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing Li@@ fan at home in the 22@@ nd round of the Chinese Super Le@@ agu@@ e.
what is more, Y@@ u D@@ ab@@ ao could not move by himself and was stret@@ ch@@ ered off@@ . after a 10-minute treatment cour@@ t@@ side, he was directly sent into an emergency am@@ bul@@ ance.
as far as the "@@ national football squ@@ ad@@ " is concer@@ ned, the possible injury of Y@@ u D@@ ab@@ ao will certainly affect China's competition for the Russia 2018 Asian Qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ers that will k@@ ick off half a month lat@@ er.
also in that gam@@ e, Y@@ u Han@@ ch@@ ao@@ 's serious injury made people more anxi@@ ous. according to a conserv@@ ative es@@ tim@@ ation, he needs a four@@ -@@ month recovery perio@@ d, that is, he will at least mis@@ s the first half of the games for the top 12 Chinese football team@@ s.
if Y@@ u D@@ ab@@ ao@@ 's injury is seri@@ ous, the fron@@ t-@@ field staff@@ ing of China's national football squ@@ ad will be great@@ ly aff@@ ec@@ ted.
however, engineers from University of Californi@@ a, Ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y, have advanced this concept and developed a tin@@ y wireless sensor that can be used to monitor the health condition inside human body.
the research@@ ers introduced their in@@ vention on the Ne@@ uro@@ n published on August 3.
on top of that, these b@@ atter@@ y-@@ free sensors can be used to stim@@ ulate ner@@ ve and mus@@ c@@ le.
this will probably offer a way to treat dis@@ orders such as ep@@ il@@ ep@@ sy or activ@@ ate human imm@@ une system.
this device has been im@@ plan@@ ted into the mus@@ cle and per@@ ip@@ her@@ al ner@@ ve of rat@@ s, and uses ul@@ tras@@ ound as energy sourc@@ e, which is also used to read collected data.
this sensor has been compres@@ sed to 1 m@@ m@@ 3, called "@@ Ne@@ ural D@@ ust@@ " which includes a pi@@ ez@@ o-@@ electric cry@@ st@@ al.
the author of this paper expl@@ ained that the cry@@ stal conver@@ ts the vibration of ul@@ tras@@ ound em@@ it@@ ted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tin@@ y transi@@ stor@@ , which is directly attached to a ner@@ ve or mus@@ cle fi@@ b@@ ers, inside the device.
voltage pe@@ ak in fi@@ bers causes changes of current circuit and cry@@ stal vibr@@ ation, so that ul@@ tras@@ onic recei@@ ver (@@ which currently is still the source that s@@ ends ul@@ tras@@ onic vibr@@ ation) can detec@@ t ec@@ ho@@ .
now that ul@@ tras@@ onic technology is very common in hospit@@ als and ul@@ tras@@ onic vibration can pen@@ et@@ rate most parts of human body, it seems to be a natural cho@@ ice.
Michael Ma@@ har@@ bi@@ z is an associ@@ ate prof@@ essor of electronic engineering and computer science at University of Californi@@ a, Ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y.
as the co-@@ corresponding author of the paper, he said in a state@@ ment, "I believe that the long-term pro@@ sp@@ ect of ne@@ ural d@@ ust is not restric@@ ted to ner@@ ve and bra@@ in, but much broad@@ er@@ ."
Mah@@ arb@@ iz@@ , together with his col@@ leagu@@ es and Jo@@ se Car@@ men@@ a, a ne@@ uro@@ scienti@@ st at University of Californi@@ a, Ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y, led the resear@@ ch.
"@@ it was ut@@ ter@@ ly impossible to adop@@ t internal tele@@ met@@ ry technology in the p@@ ast, because a tin@@ y object cannot be put into a very deep plac@@ e@@ ," expl@@ ained h@@ e.
"@@ now, however, I can take a tin@@ y object and put it near n@@ erv@@ e, organ@@ , dig@@ es@@ tive tract or mus@@ c@@ le, which then can read dat@@ a@@ ."
to test their device, Ma@@ har@@ bi@@ z and Ca@@ ar@@ men@@ a utili@@ zed six 5@@ 40@@ ns ul@@ tras@@ onic pul@@ se sent per 100@@ ms to drive sens@@ or.
but the research@@ ers feel quite confid@@ ent that they can also work in the brain and central n@@ erv@@ ous system.
"@@ if a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed patient ho@@ pes to control a computer or a robo@@ t arm@@ , you can im@@ plant this electro@@ de into his / her bra@@ in, where it can continuously work for a life@@ tim@@ e."
since the two l@@ enses work simul@@ tane@@ ously, they can dist@@ ingu@@ ish ob@@ vious front and re@@ ar land@@ scap@@ es, produc@@ ing a more sh@@ allow depth of field.

Department store gi@@ ant Mac@@ y's said on Th@@ urs@@ day that it plans to close 100 store@@ s, a dram@@ atic step that is aim@@ ed at helping the chain get ahead of a potenti@@ ally crip@@ pl@@ ing proble@@ m@@ : America, it say@@ s, has too many stores for the online shopping er@@ a.
Mac@@ y's regul@@ arly pr@@ un@@ es its store port@@ fol@@ i@@ o, often moving to close several do@@ z@@ en under@@ performing stores right after the annual holiday r@@ ush@@ .
but in dro@@ pping a sum@@ mer@@ time announc@@ ement that it will close 15 per cent of its 7@@ 28 loc@@ ations, the chain appears to be adop@@ ting a more agg@@ res@@ sive post@@ ure than many of its retail industry counter@@ parts about gir@@ ding its fle@@ et for the reality of a fast@@ -@@ changing shopping environment.
ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans and sho@@ pper@@ s pass in front of a Mac@@ y's store in New Yor@@ k.
the retail gi@@ ant has said it plans to close 100 sto@@ res.
Mac@@ y's has plenty of reasons to sc@@ ram@@ ble to make a chang@@ e: many of its stores are located in sm@@ all, regional m@@ all@@ s, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard@@ -@@ hit by the rise of e-@@ commer@@ ce.
and the department store category has generally stru@@ gg@@ led as sho@@ pper@@ s increasingly turn to off@@ -@@ price re@@ tail@@ ers such as T@@ .@@ J@@ . Max@@ x and fast@@ -@@ fashion players such as H & M to buy their clo@@ th@@ es.
these fac@@ tors, along with shor@@ t-@@ term h@@ itch@@ es such as dec@@ reas@@ ed sp@@ ending by international tou@@ rists and un@@ seas@@ on@@ able we@@ a@@ ther, have left Mac@@ y's in a rou@@ gh pat@@ ch that has stret@@ ched for more than a year.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, the company said it saw a 2.@@ 6 per cent drop in compar@@ able sales in the most recent quar@@ ter, a we@@ ak performance that was non@@ eth@@ eless an improvement over the dis@@ mal 6.@@ 1 per cent year-@@ over@@ -@@ year decline it recorded in the previous quar@@ ter.
the re@@ tail@@ er's re@@ venue was $@@ US@@ 5.@@ 8@@ 7 billion ($@@ A@@ 7.@@ 64 billi@@ on@@ ), down 3.@@ 9 per cent from the same period last year.
Mac@@ y's said the store clo@@ su@@ res would probably cost it about $@@ US@@ 1 billion in annual sal@@ es.
and at one time, such a large bat@@ ch of store clo@@ su@@ res might have been viewed as a re@@ tail@@ er's conc@@ ession of de@@ feat@@ .
yet the company's stock so@@ ared 17 per cent on Th@@ urs@@ day, a sign that investors view the move as a pro@@ active measure that por@@ ten@@ ds a strong@@ er future for Mac@@ y@@ '@@ s.
in some way@@ s, it should not come as a sur@@ prise that Mac@@ y's is sl@@ ash@@ ing sto@@ res.
Ter@@ ry L@@ und@@ g@@ ren@@ , the re@@ tail@@ er's chief execu@@ tive, has said before that the chain simply had too many sto@@ res.
Ex@@ ecu@@ tives have been saying for some time that they are embr@@ acing a strategy that puts particular emphas@@ is on rou@@ gh@@ ly 150 of their top-@@ performing store@@ s, trying to wr@@ ing more sales out of those al@@ read@@ y-@@ produc@@ tive loc@@ ations.
J@@ ef@@ f Gen@@ net@@ te, the Mac@@ y's executive who has been appointed to replace L@@ und@@ gre@@ n in 201@@ 7, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and prof@@ it@@ ability have been sli@@ d@@ ing.
"@@ we recog@@ n@@ ise that these locations do not yi@@ eld an ad@@ equ@@ ate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that refl@@ ects our asp@@ ir@@ ations for the Mac@@ y's brand@@ ," Gen@@ net@@ te said.
the company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.
Mac@@ y's said it is still fin@@ al@@ ising which stores it would shut@@ ter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be sl@@ ash@@ ed.
the re@@ tail@@ er will not pul@@ l out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently oper@@ ates store@@ s, but will look to close stores that are in we@@ ak loc@@ ations.
the move is likely un@@ welcome news to m@@ all oper@@ ators, who count on big ten@@ ants like Mac@@ y's to at@@ tract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping cent@@ res.

the website T@@ read@@ m@@ ill Reviews commission@@ ed Em@@ La@@ b P & K to test 12 water bott@@ les of four different types - scre@@ w@@ -@@ top@@ , sli@@ de-@@ top@@ , squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e-@@ top@@ , and str@@ aw@@ -@@ top@@ .
each water bottle had been used by an ath@@ le@@ te for a week without being wash@@ ed.
your ref@@ ill@@ able water bottle could be as dir@@ ty as a do@@ g to@@ y.
"@@ based on the 12 water bott@@ les we te@@ ste@@ d, we found that re@@ us@@ able drin@@ king contain@@ ers may be cra@@ w@@ ling with an al@@ arm@@ ing number of vi@@ able b@@ acter@@ ia cell@@ s: more than 300@@ ,000 col@@ on@@ y-@@ form@@ ing units per square c@@ en@@ time@@ ter (C@@ F@@ U / s@@ q c@@ m@@ )@@ ," T@@ read@@ m@@ ill Reviews said.
sli@@ de-@@ top were found to have the highest ger@@ m content, with more than 900@@ ,000 col@@ on@@ y-@@ form@@ ing units per square c@@ en@@ timet@@ re (C@@ F@@ U / sq@@ ) cm on a@@ ver@@ age.
the bott@@ les h@@ arb@@ oured gr@@ am@@ -@@ positive co@@ c@@ ci@@ , which can lead to skin infec@@ tions, p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia, or blood po@@ is@@ on@@ ing.
squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e-@@ top bott@@ les were nex@@ t-@@ wor@@ se with 16@@ 2@@ ,000 CF@@ U / s@@ q c@@ m, and scre@@ w@@ -@@ top contain@@ ers hos@@ ted just under 160@@ ,000 CF@@ U / s@@ q c@@ m.
"@@ drin@@ king from these bott@@ les can still be wor@@ se than eating a me@@ al from your pet@@ 's dish@@ ," the site add@@ ed.
a far better picture emerg@@ ed from tests on str@@ aw@@ -@@ top bott@@ les, which were found to contain a fr@@ action of the b@@ acter@@ ia of other bott@@ les - just 25 CF@@ U / s@@ q c@@ m.
this may be because water dri@@ ps to the bottom of the stra@@ w rather than stic@@ king around to at@@ tract moist@@ ure@@ -@@ lo@@ ving ger@@ ms.
the ger@@ ms that were present in the str@@ aw@@ -@@ top bott@@ les were described as "@@ mostly harm@@ less@@ ."
"@@ based on our test resul@@ ts, we suggest op@@ ting for a str@@ aw@@ -@@ top bott@@ le, both for the low pre@@ val@@ ence of b@@ acter@@ ia and the lack of harm@@ ful ger@@ m@@ s," the site said.
we also know that when it comes to water bott@@ les and b@@ acter@@ ia, stainless steel is a better choice than plas@@ tic@@ .
ad@@ dition@@ ally, water bott@@ les without cre@@ v@@ ices and tou@@ gh@@ -to-@@ clean spo@@ ts are less likely to host ger@@ ms.
the site advis@@ es read@@ ers to wash water bott@@ les after each use, ide@@ ally with a we@@ ak ble@@ ach solu@@ tion.
in the United States the Democratic Party recently nom@@ in@@ ated Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton as its presid@@ ential can@@ did@@ ate.
if the results of the latest pol@@ ls hold true at election time, America will swe@@ ar in its first female president in Jan@@ u@@ ary.
the previous wee@@ k, across the pon@@ d, British Prime Minister Ther@@ es@@ a May was negoti@@ ating the terms of Brit@@ ain@@ 's exit from Europe with German@@ y's Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angel@@ a Mer@@ k@@ el.
women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through educ@@ ation, ambi@@ tion and hard work.
and young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of lead@@ er@@ ship.
so is the long and hard b@@ attle for wom@@ en@@ 's equ@@ ality finally over@@ ?
Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton is po@@ ised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sp@@ here wom@@ en@@ 's leadership is still a conten@@ ti@@ ous issu@@ e.
well, not enti@@ rel@@ y.
in the religious sp@@ here wom@@ en@@ 's leadership remains a conten@@ ti@@ ous issu@@ e.
last week Pop@@ e Franc@@ is announced a new comm@@ ission to consider whether women should be made de@@ ac@@ ons in the Cath@@ olic Chur@@ ch.
the Ang@@ lic@@ an Church con@@ sec@@ rated Li@@ b@@ by L@@ ane as its first female b@@ is@@ ho@@ p in January 2015, but this was only after a fail@@ ed attempt in 201@@ 2.
while the Jewish Re@@ form movement has been ord@@ ain@@ ing female r@@ ab@@ bis since the early 19@@ 70@@ s, and the Con@@ serv@@ ative movement since the early 19@@ 80@@ s, in Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x Jud@@ a@@ ism the no@@ tion of female r@@ ab@@ bis is still ho@@ tly con@@ te@@ ste@@ d.
in November 2015, the Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x R@@ ab@@ b@@ in@@ ical Council of America - in its third attempt to ste@@ m the growing ti@@ de of support for Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x wom@@ en@@ 's r@@ ab@@ b@@ in@@ ical ord@@ ination - published a ster@@ n pro@@ cl@@ am@@ ation dec@@ lar@@ ing the il@@ legi@@ tim@@ acy of female r@@ ab@@ b@@ is.
not without ir@@ on@@ y, as Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton wr@@ apped up the democr@@ atic presid@@ ential nom@@ ination a group of leading American Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x r@@ ab@@ bis op@@ posed to wom@@ en@@ 's ord@@ ination launched a series of "@@ hear@@ ing@@ s" on this dispu@@ ted subjec@@ t.
why is there such dis@@ par@@ ity between the sec@@ ular real@@ m and the sac@@ red@@ ?
Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x Jud@@ ais@@ m, like most religi@@ ons, see@@ ks stability in what it con@@ sid@@ ers end@@ uring traditional valu@@ es.
this find@@ s expression in resist@@ ing the pressure to con@@ form to a changing soci@@ ety.
but the ob@@ session with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost@@ .
and the cost of such sing@@ le-@@ mind@@ ed@@ ness can par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically be the under@@ mining of tradition itself by dep@@ riv@@ ing the traditional community of the oxy@@ gen it needs to remain vibr@@ ant.
in The G@@ un@@ s of Aug@@ ust, a military history of the First World W@@ ar, Bar@@ bar@@ a Tu@@ ch@@ man high@@ lights the dang@@ er of pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ sing tradition in what has become known as the "@@ tr@@ ag@@ edy of the red trou@@ ser@@ s."
in the lead up to W@@ W@@ I, as war@@ fare shif@@ ted from fi@@ ghting at close quar@@ ters to heav@@ i@@ er arti@@ ll@@ ery fi@@ red from greater dist@@ ance, it become advant@@ age@@ ous to conc@@ e@@ al sol@@ di@@ ers for as long as possible.
the British and German arm@@ ies re@@ ac@@ ted to this change by ex@@ changing their bright col@@ oured uni@@ forms for dra@@ b gre@@ ys and brow@@ n@@ s.
the French sol@@ di@@ ers, however, still wor@@ e the same red cap@@ s and trou@@ ser@@ s, mar@@ king them out as easy tar@@ get@@ s.
the sugges@@ tion of the French war min@@ ister Ad@@ ol@@ p@@ he M@@ essi@@ my that his arm@@ ies do lik@@ ew@@ ise was met with ri@@ dic@@ ule and resist@@ ance.
the red tr@@ ous@@ ers represented army pri@@ de and presti@@ ge and military tra@@ dition@@ al@@ ists were not prepared to give it up.
at a par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ary hear@@ ing, a former war minist@@ er, E@@ u@@ gen@@ e E@@ ti@@ enn@@ e, spoke for Fr@@ ance.
"@@ elimin@@ ate the red trou@@ ser@@ s@@ ?" he cri@@ ed.
ne@@ ver@@ !
"@@ that b@@ lin@@ d and im@@ bec@@ ile attach@@ ment to the most visible of all col@@ our@@ s," wrote M@@ essi@@ my after@@ ward@@ s, "@@ was to have cru@@ el consequ@@ enc@@ es."
faith leaders grap@@ pl@@ ing with wom@@ en@@ 's incl@@ usion in religious leadership ro@@ les are in dang@@ er of the same p@@ it@@ f@@ all.
by foc@@ using exclusi@@ vely on "@@ what is tra@@ dition@@ al@@ " for their religion rather than as@@ king the cruc@@ ial ques@@ tion: "@@ what change is necessary for religion to th@@ riv@@ e@@ ?" they risk ali@@ en@@ ating 50 per cent of their f@@ loc@@ k.
they also de@@ pri@@ ve the entire community of the tal@@ ent, skills and enthusi@@ as@@ m that women would otherwise contribu@@ te.
in@@ sist@@ ing that men continue to wear the tr@@ ous@@ ers when it comes to religion might be tra@@ dition@@ al, bu@@ t, as the p@@ ant@@ al@@ on rou@@ ge deb@@ acle illustr@@ ates, it may not be worth the price.

whil@@ st we recog@@ n@@ ise that everyone is entitled to their own personal opin@@ ion, it is not helpful when infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory comments are posted on such website@@ s.
the f@@ an, who works in administr@@ ation, was then told he would have to pick the ticket up in person from former police Chief In@@ spec@@ tor C@@ lif@@ f E@@ ag@@ er, who joined the club last month after a 3@@ 5-@@ year career in the police forc@@ e.
the letter continu@@ ed: "I need to advis@@ e you that the gran@@ ting of your season ticket will be '@@ condition@@ ed@@ ' and subject to you sig@@ ning an '@@ Agre@@ ed Be@@ havi@@ our@@ al Con@@ trac@@ t@@ ' (@@ AB@@ C) which will request that you ref@@ rain from po@@ sting der@@ og@@ atory or infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory comments regarding the Club or people represent@@ ing the club in the future on any social media website@@ s, or car@@ rying out any other form of behavi@@ our that could be deemed to be on an anti-@@ social nat@@ ure@@ ."
speaking to the D@@ aily T@@ ele@@ graph@@ , the fan described how he called the club after paying for his season ticket, which never showed up and two days later the letter arrived in the post@@ .
y@@ ester@@ day, he went to the meeting with the club and said: "@@ they told me I had been t@@ we@@ eting exc@@ essi@@ vely and ca@@ using other people to t@@ we@@ et as well - which is ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous@@ .'

cycl@@ ing at the height of summer in such a ste@@ ep@@ ly p@@ itch@@ ed place as Croati@@ a might not fit every@@ one's idea of luxur@@ y, but north D@@ al@@ m@@ ati@@ a is said to be an easier ride than sou@@ th, our s@@ add@@ les are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in care@@ free and confid@@ ent manner all those months ago there was a box we fail@@ ed to tic@@ k that could have sec@@ ured us the assistance of a b@@ atter@@ y-@@ pow@@ ered e-@@ bi@@ ke.
the luxury part of the deal is our flo@@ ating home for the wee@@ k, the brand new Mel@@ od@@ y.
at the end of the ride we can d@@ ump our bi@@ kes on the qu@@ ay for our guid@@ es I@@ van and I@@ v@@ ana to st@@ ow, and j@@ ump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mi@@ x it with sea ur@@ ch@@ in@@ s, shar@@ p roc@@ ks and other people on the h@@ ank@@ y sized stri@@ ps of pe@@ b@@ bl@@ es that Croati@@ ans call a beach.
in late June the sea is a perfect temperat@@ ure, all agre@@ e: c@@ ool enough to ref@@ res@@ h, but not col@@ d.
the Mel@@ od@@ y is stoc@@ ked with mas@@ ks and s@@ nor@@ k@@ els and a couple of k@@ ay@@ aks should anyone feel ener@@ ge@@ tic after a hard morning in the s@@ add@@ le.

"@@ breakfast and din@@ ner are at eight o@@ '@@ cloc@@ k@@ ," I@@ van announced to the new in@@ take at the welcome bri@@ ef@@ ing as we set s@@ ail from the beautiful old port of Tro@@ gir@@ , near S@@ pl@@ it.
one ring of the ship@@ 's b@@ ell decl@@ ares the buffet open and another at the end of the me@@ al calls for sil@@ ence and listen carefully to the next bri@@ ef@@ ing.
"@@ good mo@@ an@@ ing@@ !" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British cont@@ ing@@ ent.

L@@ our@@ des prep@@ ares for pil@@ gri@@ ms in shad@@ ow of attacks
people gather during the annual Cath@@ olic pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age at the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame de L@@ our@@ d@@ es.
French security forces are on high al@@ ert as thousands of Cath@@ ol@@ ics conver@@ ge on the sh@@ r@@ ine of L@@ our@@ des for an annual pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age un@@ fol@@ ding in the shad@@ ow of a string of ter@@ ror attack@@ s.
each year, ten@@ s of thousands f@@ lock to the sanc@@ tu@@ ary in the foo@@ th@@ ills of the Py@@ re@@ ne@@ es for the Fe@@ ast of the As@@ su@@ mp@@ tion on August 15, mar@@ king the as@@ cent of the Vir@@ gin M@@ ary into Heav@@ en.
this year@@ 's pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age comes as Cath@@ ol@@ ics re@@ el from the k@@ illing of an el@@ der@@ ly French pri@@ est on July 26 by two Islam@@ ist extrem@@ ist@@ s, who stor@@ med his church in northern France during M@@ ass and sli@@ t his thro@@ at.
J@@ acqu@@ es Ham@@ el@@ 's mur@@ der came under two weeks after a Tun@@ is@@ ian -- said by investig@@ ators to have become rad@@ ic@@ al@@ ised by online ji@@ h@@ ad@@ ist videos -- pl@@ ough@@ ed a tr@@ uck into a Bas@@ til@@ le Day crow@@ d in the Ri@@ vi@@ era city of N@@ ice, k@@ illing 8@@ 5 people.
many in France are now le@@ ery about atten@@ ding public gather@@ ings after three larg@@ e-@@ scale attacks in 18 month@@ s.
with tourist arriv@@ als in the country pl@@ um@@ met@@ ing, authorities had wor@@ ri@@ ed that the number of visitors to this year@@ 's pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age would be shar@@ ply down.
but f@@ ears of mass canc@@ ell@@ ations have fail@@ ed to materi@@ al@@ ise -- and some organis@@ ers say there has even been a la@@ st@@ -minute sur@@ g@@ e.
around 25@@ ,000 faith@@ ful are exp@@ ec@@ ted, including mass groups from Italy and Belgi@@ um and a dele@@ gation of around 200 members of the Eastern Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x branch of Christi@@ an@@ ity.
many pil@@ gri@@ ms say they will not be c@@ ow@@ ed.
"@@ we're not going to stop liv@@ ing@@ ," Christi@@ an, a 6@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old visit@@ or, told A@@ F@@ P, descri@@ bing prayer as the "@@ only weap@@ on@@ " in the face of viol@@ ence.
"@@ it's important to show that life goes on@@ ," said Mat@@ thi@@ e@@ u Gu@@ ign@@ ard, one of the coordin@@ ator@@ s.
it's not because a few f@@ an@@ atic@@ s try to so@@ w fear that we should ab@@ and@@ on our fai@@ th, our beli@@ ef@@ s, our way of liv@@ ing.
several major events have been canc@@ elled in France since the Nice attack over security concer@@ n@@ s, including a huge fle@@ a market in the northern city of L@@ ille and the European road cycl@@ ing champ@@ ion@@ ships that had been set to take place in Nice in Septem@@ ber.
"@@ for the past wee@@ k, my fear was that my phone would be r@@ inging with canc@@ ell@@ ation@@ s," Fab@@ i@@ en Le@@ je@@ us@@ ne, the pri@@ est in charge of the official pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age said last week@@ end.
in@@ ste@@ ad, the attacks appeared to mobil@@ ise the faith@@ ful, he said, re@@ porting a la@@ st@@ -minute book@@ ings sp@@ ur@@ t.
the head of the local hotel work@@ ers' un@@ ion, Christian G@@ el@@ is, confirm@@ ed signs of "@@ increased interest@@ " in the pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age in the wa@@ ke of the attack@@ s.
security has been dram@@ atically ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed around the sanc@@ tu@@ ary built around the sh@@ r@@ ine, where the Vir@@ gin M@@ ary is said to have appeared in a g@@ rot@@ to to Ber@@ n@@ ad@@ ette Sou@@ bir@@ ous, a poor sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d gir@@ l, in 18@@ 5@@ 8.
around 250 police and two do@@ z@@ en sol@@ di@@ ers, including b@@ om@@ b dis@@ pos@@ al experts and offic@@ ers with s@@ ni@@ ff@@ er do@@ g@@ s, have been deplo@@ yed to protect the area.
pil@@ gri@@ ms fil@@ ing through security bar@@ ri@@ ers have their b@@ ags sear@@ ched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a do@@ z@@ en to thre@@ e.
C@@ ather@@ ine Sim@@ co@@ x, who made a pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age from the north east of England to L@@ our@@ des earlier this month described the he@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed secur@@ ity.
"@@ by Th@@ urs@@ day morning, there were armed gu@@ ards inside the sanc@@ tu@@ aries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal bar@@ ri@@ ers@@ ) with b@@ ags being sear@@ ched on the way in@@ ," she told The Loc@@ al.
"@@ this total fre@@ aked my three kids out who are used to L@@ our@@ des & it was hard to not sc@@ are them when they asked why it was happen@@ ing@@ ," she said.
it didn't spo@@ il my experience, but it s@@ add@@ ened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reas@@ su@@ red by the meas@@ ures.
the route of Fri@@ day@@ 's opening proc@@ ession has also been cur@@ tail@@ ed -- instead of starting in the town of L@@ our@@ des and proceed@@ ing to the sanc@@ tu@@ ary, it will start and end at the sh@@ r@@ ine.
other measures taken including shut@@ ting down the air@@ space above L@@ our@@ des to f@@ ligh@@ ts, closing off the stre@@ ets around the sanc@@ tu@@ ary to traffic and replac@@ ing rub@@ b@@ ish b@@ ins with transparent plastic b@@ ag@@ s.

L@@ our@@ des attrac@@ ts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Cath@@ olic pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age in the world.
many visitors bring s@@ ick or disabled rel@@ ati@@ ves, who come to ba@@ the in a spring in the c@@ ave where Ber@@ n@@ ad@@ ette said she saw Mar@@ y, believ@@ ing the water to have heal@@ ing proper@@ ties.
Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry Cas@@ til@@ lo@@ , another of the organis@@ ers, described this year@@ 's gather@@ ing as "@@ a bit un@@ us@@ ual@@ " given "the thre@@ at that seems to have taken root in Franc@@ e."
but "@@ it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experienc@@ e@@ ," he assu@@ red.
Fran@@ co@@ ise, a 58@@ -@@ year-@@ old volunte@@ er who was assist@@ ing s@@ ick pil@@ gri@@ ms, ad@@ mitted she found the presence of sol@@ di@@ ers in f@@ ati@@ gu@@ es "@@ a little over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming@@ ."

Olympic offici@@ als try to clean gre@@ en-@@ ting@@ ed di@@ ving pool
Olympic di@@ vers planning to practice Fri@@ day arrived to a closed pool as offici@@ als took more time to clean the gre@@ en-@@ ting@@ ed water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Gam@@ es.
the water suddenly changed color Tu@@ es@@ day, mid@@ way through the syn@@ chron@@ ized di@@ ving ev@@ ents.
offici@@ als ins@@ isted the water was safe for comp@@ et@@ ing, even after a larg@@ er, adj@@ ac@@ ent pool used for water pol@@ o and syn@@ chron@@ ized swimming also turned a ligh@@ ter sh@@ ade of gre@@ en.
the di@@ ving well was sh@@ ut down when ath@@ le@@ tes arrived for morning warm@@ up@@ s, though it did finally open at 1 p@@ .@@ m. local time - just 2 1 / 2 hours before the start of the wom@@ en@@ 's 3-@@ me@@ ter event.
the water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shad@@ ed gre@@ en.
American di@@ ver Ab@@ by John@@ st@@ on, who is comp@@ eting on the spr@@ ing@@ board, said she showed up for her warm@@ up, only to learn the pool was sh@@ ut down without any notice.
she wrote on Twitter that "@@ # Fi@@ x@@ The@@ Sw@@ amp@@ " should start tren@@ d@@ ing.
British di@@ ver T@@ om D@@ al@@ e@@ y, who won br@@ on@@ ze in the syn@@ ch@@ ro platform ev@@ ent, also commen@@ ted on the state of the pool in a Twitter post@@ .
ho@@ pe@@ fully that means we haven@@ 't been di@@ ving in anything too bad the last couple of day@@ s!
Mari@@ o An@@ dr@@ ad@@ a, chief spo@@ k@@ es@@ man for the local organiz@@ ing commit@@ te@@ e, stres@@ sed that the pool was safe for competi@@ tion, cle@@ aring the way for the 3-@@ me@@ ter pre@@ li@@ min@@ ari@@ es.
he conc@@ ed@@ ed that some ath@@ le@@ tes were bo@@ ther@@ ed by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool.
"@@ we re@@ iter@@ ate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any thre@@ at to the health of the ath@@ le@@ te@@ s," he said.
in the first day of this water situ@@ ation, one or two ath@@ le@@ tes compl@@ ained about their eyes being itch@@ y.
this was a result that the first re@@ action when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chem@@ icals - ch@@ lor@@ ine - that is very common in swimming po@@ ol@@ s.
we reduced immediately the quanti@@ ty.
we re@@ tested the water and it was totally within the paramet@@ ers.
Sim@@ on L@@ ang@@ for@@ d, chief spo@@ k@@ es@@ man for the Maria L@@ en@@ k A@@ qu@@ atic@@ s Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional clean@@ ing.
"the reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possi@@ ble@@ ," L@@ ang@@ ford said in a state@@ ment.
An@@ dr@@ ada said offici@@ als were caught off guard by the po@@ ol@@ 's det@@ eri@@ or@@ ating condition@@ .
"@@ chem@@ istry is not an ex@@ act sci@@ ence@@ ," he said.
some things, as you can see, went longer than exp@@ ec@@ ted.
rain the past couple of days made it even tou@@ gh@@ er to get the water color back to norm@@ al.
"the rain doesn't help@@ ," An@@ dr@@ ada said.
he added that ath@@ le@@ tes had access to dry@@ -@@ land training in the morning, but conc@@ ed@@ ed that "@@ was not ide@@ al@@ ."
he expl@@ ained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased al@@ k@@ al@@ ine level@@ s, much like aquari@@ um water can turn green when not monit@@ ored proper@@ ly.
when we went to fix the gre@@ en, there was a discus@@ sion about the best chem@@ ic@@ als.
we can't use too much chem@@ icals in the water because ath@@ le@@ tes are training in it, "@@ An@@ dr@@ ada said.
we certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning gre@@ en.
once it turned gre@@ en, we again made another bit of a mistak@@ e.
